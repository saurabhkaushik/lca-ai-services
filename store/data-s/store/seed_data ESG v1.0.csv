Climate crisis[edit],Environment,ESG
"The body of research providing evidence of global trends in climate change has led investors—pension funds, holders of insurance reserves—to begin to screen investments in terms of their impact on the perceived factors of climate change. Fossil fuel-reliant industries are less attractive.[32] In the UK, investment policies were particularly affected by the conclusions of the Stern Review in 2006, a report commissioned by the British government to provide an economic analysis of the issues associated with climate change. Its conclusions pointed towards the necessity of including considerations of climate change and environmental issues in all financial calculations and that the benefits of early action on climate change would outweigh its costs.[33]",Environment,ESG

In every area of the debate from the depletion of resources to the future of industries dependent upon diminishing raw materials the question of the obsolescence of a company's product or service is becoming central to the value ascribed to that company.

Management structure[edit],Governance,ESG
"The system of internal procedures and controls that makes up the management structure of a company is in the valuation of that company's equity.[25] Attention has been focused in recent years on the balance of power between the CEO and the board of directors and specifically the differences between the European model and the US model—in the US studies have found that 80% of companies have a CEO who is also the chairman of the board, in the UK and the European model it was found that 90% of the largest companies split the roles of CEO and chairman.[44]",Governance,ESG

Governance is an essential factor in this, examining how well an organization governs itself. Governance focuses on issues such as executive remuneration, donations, political lobbying, tax strategy, board diversity, structure, corruption, and bribery. Proper governance helps align issues between stakeholders at different levels, support continued growth and long-term strategy.",Governance,ESG
"Governance details the inner working of the business itself. High standards of governance help ensure that the business in question is not involved in any illegal practices—an obvious red flag for investors. But more than that, governance promotes accurate and transparent financial processes. It assigned rights to stockholders. It helps eliminate the risks associated with conflicts of interest. Essentially, it exists to ensure ethical practices at all levels, protecting the business and those who invest in it from penalties and risks associated with poor management.",Governance,ESG
"An important thing to remember is that ESG isn't a separate, independent, niche problem; it has fundamental effects on your approach to doing business (i.e., building products to be recycled, designing processes so they can be monitored for compliance with internal and external goals, etc.). Together, these are helping create frameworks for effectively approaching these issues using a system composed of people, processes, and tech working together to help companies effectively incorporate ESG as an essential component of their overall strategy, risk, and governance programs. And this means reduced risk for investors.",Governance,ESG

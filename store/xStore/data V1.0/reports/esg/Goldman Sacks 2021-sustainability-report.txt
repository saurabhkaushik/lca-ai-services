	Letter to Our Shareholders	INTRODUCTIONFellow Shareholders:As a financial institution, we work hard every day to help our clients take on their biggest challenges. Their success is essential to our growth. And in 2021, 	David Solomon as supply chain disruptions spread, geopolitical 	Chairman and tensions rose, and inflation took off, we strengthened 	Chief Executive Officer our focus on helping our clients achieve their sustainability objectives.
Our focus may be straightforward, but the sustainability transition itself is complex. If the world is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, financial institutions like ours will need to partner with clients to reimagine not just how they power their businesses, but also the entire energy ecosystem, ranging from long-duration storage to carbon capture technology. Our own Carbonomics research indicates that $56 trillion of investment in green infrastructure is needed to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement.And in the near term, we won’t be able to rely on renewables alone. The current energy crisis has only underscored how important it is to maintain access to reliable and affordable energy, and to do so we will need to use all the tools at our disposal. At Goldman Sachs, we will continue providing support, capital, and advice to traditional energy producers both in the near team, as they supply energy, and in the long term, as they decarbonize their businesses.Beyond targets and plans, clients need capital and tools to help them align their sustainability goals with their financial well-being, and as a trusted advisor, we are well-positioned to provide them the commercial solutions they need, whether it’s an ESG-linked Transaction Banking account or a clean energy-themed ETF.But commercial solutions on their own won’t solve everything. Not enough private capital will flow to green infrastructure projects unless public policy creates the right incentives. Our economists estimate that the energy sector will need an additional $1.5 trillion in capital expenditures per year by 2032 to ensure a smooth transition to a lowcarbon economy, and the economic ramifications of the war in Ukraine have only added to the sense of urgency. For its part, the US Congress could help by passing the Build Back Better Act’s energy provisions, which include support for greater investment in renewables and electric vehicles, methane restrictions, and carbon capture tax credits.

Activating the Power of the Financial System for a Sustainable FutureAt Goldman Sachs, we have placed sustainability at the core of our business. Building on decades of experience, we have accelerated our commitment to sustainable finance as we continue to put our broader purpose to work: to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity for our clients, people, partners, and communities in which we work.In December, we published our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report, Accelerating Transition, in which we shared how we are leveraging the full breadth of our business to help support the low-carbon transition efforts of our clients, as well as our roadmap to deliver on progress for our commitment to align our business with a net zero by 2050 pathway. Our 2020 Sustainability Report tracked our progress in advancing the climate transition and driving inclusive growth — the two holistic pillars that underpin our sustainability efforts as a firm. In this report, we will share how we are continuing to execute on our climate transition and inclusive growth commitments through development of innovative solutions and new commercial capabilities. As we progress toward our own goals, we are supporting our clients on their individual journeys and are driving sustainable change in the real economy.We believe that capital is critical to transform the global economy — yet its full potential is still untapped. At Goldman Sachs, we recognize it takes an interconnected, converging ecosystem of stakeholders, capital, and partnerships to mobilize capital toward sustainable outcomes. Our firm leverages our unique position at the center of global markets to catalyze vital connections at scale across the financial system, in collaboration with our stakeholders.
We remain focused on where we believe we are able to drive the greatest impact — our commercial work with clients. Through market intelligence, financing, and advisory services, we help our clients build the capabilities they need to navigate complex sustainability challenges. With a relentless focus on driving results, a commitment to excellence in service, and a firm fully mobilized to deploy capital and resources at scale, we believe that Goldman Sachs is well-equipped to develop innovative solutions and tools to meet the needs of our clients and the market. Systemic change requires interconnected solutions. Across our work in advancing both the climate transition and inclusive growth, our work with clients is bolstered by collaborations with partners across industries, regions, and disciplines. Sustainable economic growth and the transition to a low-carbon economy cannot be driven in isolation. When we work together, we can drive a greater and more holistic impact. Our collaboration with Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Asian Development Bank on the launch of the Climate Innovation and Development Fund is one example of how we are leveraging partnerships to help address financing gaps in emerging markets, where we must consider region-specific challenges and opportunities to enable and accelerate the climate transition.Our inclusive growth strategy is grounded in our expertise derived from investing in underserved communities, and it is further catalyzed by partnership and philanthropic capital. In order to drive commercial solutions for the communities in which we serve, we have built connections with stakeholders whom we listen to and learn from during an ongoing process. In advancing inclusive growth, we remain focused on increasing access to affordable, quality care and opportunities for members of these communities, whether those communities be large or small.Importantly, we recognize that our people are crucial in driving progress on sustainability, and they underpin all our commercial work with clients and partners. As such, we are continuing to build our capacity as a firm and centralize sustainability, diversity, and inclusivity efforts across our organization. In turn, we leverage the insights gained from our experience to support our clients on their journeys.Our Strategic FrameworkTo accelerate the climate transitionWe are expanding the scale and speed of our impact. We look to mobilize capital, accelerate innovation, and fuel the transition to a low-carbon economy at both a client and systemic level, grounded in the insights we gain through partnerships and our flagship research initiatives, such as GS SUSTAIN and Carbonomics.To advance inclusive growthWe’re actively listening to, amplifying, and partnering with people, communities, and organizations to improve accessibility, affordability, and outcomes to help drive more inclusive, sustainable growth. We’re continuing to accelerate our work in this space through signature initiatives, including One Million Black Women, 10,000 Small Businesses, and 10,000 Women. We acknowledge that long-term outcomes will be the true test of our impact in helping to build a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive economy.At Goldman Sachs, we have identified two imperatives through which we can make the most material impact as a firm: climate transition and inclusive growth. We continue to view these two themes as key drivers of risk and opportunity for our firm and our clients.What We’ve Learned Synergies between climate transition and inclusive growth:• Complex, large-scale challenges require interconnected, dynamic, and scalable solutions.• Working with clients, partners, and our people amplifies our impact.We also remain focused on the growing impacts of climate change on sustainable, inclusive economic growth. We remain steadfast in our belief that growth that is not inclusive is not sustainable, and we remain committed to supporting an inclusive transition. Our work here is just beginning, and we will continue to report on our areas of focus and impact in this space.OUR PURPOSETo Advance Sustainable Economic Growth and Financial OpportunityADVANCING THE CLIMATE TRANSITIONClean EnergySustainable TransportSustainable Food & AgricultureWaste & MaterialsEcosystem ServicesDRIVING INCLUSIVE GROWTH Accessible & Innovative HealthcareFinancial InclusionAccessible & Affordable EducationCommunitiesACHIEVING OUR PURPOSE	What We Do: Our Work With Clients  	How We Do It: Our Firm  	How We Address Gaps:  We will continue to develop solutions 	Goldman Sachs has also operationalized 	Our Partnerships, Engagement,  that meet our clients’ needs.

Our Commitment to Drive Sustainable OutcomesAs a global financial institution, we recognize that capital is most powerful in advancing sustainable outcomes when deployed with a holistic lens. 	~$300B	$750B$167B	$50BIn Climate Transition	In Inclusive GrowthWe understand that there are gaps in how capital is deployed throughout our world’s financial systems, and we seek to both illuminate those gaps and to support clients with capital, knowledge, and resources. In 2019, we crystallized our efforts with a commitment to deploy $750 billion toward sustainable finance, advisory, and investment activities by 2030. We took this step because we recognized that advancing climate transition and inclusive growth challenges will require innovation, mobilization, and united efforts toward systemic change.Since setting our ten-year goal, we’ve achieved approximately $300 billion in commercial activity, including $167 billion in climate transition, $50 billion in inclusive growth, and the remainder in multiple themes.$10BCommitment in direct investment capital and $100 million in philanthropic capital over the next decade to address opportunity gaps for at least one million Black women, as part of our One Million Black Women initiative $1B+Raised to date from Loop Money Market Funds, which shares 10% of net revenues to fund programs focused on housing and education$19MInvestment in Wonderschool, a Blackled innovative child care technology company$3B+Deployed in 2021 through our Urban Investment Group, lending and investing in underserved places and people through real estate projects, social enterprises, and lending facilities for small businesses2050Committed to aligning our business with a net zero by 2050 pathway 2030Committed to achieving net zero emissions in our operations and 150+Corporate clients engaged across 12 industry groups $2.2BIn January 2021, led Shoals Technology’s IPO, the largest-ever US-listed IPO in and shared an initial set of sectoral goals  for 2030 1,000+Released the Marquee Carbon Portfolio Analytics tool to help clients measure and manage their carbon emissions exposure across their equities and credit portfolios, with more than 1,000 unique users in the first months of launchsupply chain by 20301,172Updated our US proxy voting policy to consider director race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, as well as gender — we voted against directors at 1,172 companies in 2021 due to lack of board diversitythrough our cross-firm Decarbonization offering$1BGlobal thematic environmental equityfocused strategies topped $1 billion Assets Under Supervision (AUS) in 2021the renewables sector~1,800Transactions reviewed for environmental and social riskIn the past year, we achieved meaningful outcomes across a number of key initiatives:

Operationalizing Our Ambition
At Goldman Sachs, we have developed a firmwide commercial model that leverages the full breadth and depth of our franchise, with the goal of bringing the best of Goldman Sachs’ offerings to all our sustainable finance-related efforts. We have operationalized our ambition to meet our targets for shareholders, to retain top talent, and to meet the needs of our clients. With this approach, Goldman Sachs can move nimbly, continually improve our offerings, and better respond to today’s challenges for our clients, our partners, and our people. Following the announcement of our 10year sustainable finance target, we launched dedicated Sustainability Councils within each of our business segments. Within each business, a divisional Sustainability Council of senior leaders provides the capacity to formulate, streamline, and scale innovation and product development. These councils have become a central point of connectivity for our firm and a catalyst for sustainability-related commercial initiatives across our business. INTRODUCTIONTo ensure global coverage of our sustainable financerelated efforts, we also have regionally focused Sustainability Councils that partner with our businesses and connect the firm to our clients. This integrated approach has allowed us to deliver OneGS to our clients globally — working across the firm and leveraging the expertise of our people and resources across different areas of our business and regions to provide differentiated, innovative sustainable finance products and offerings. These councils have not only transformed how our clients engage with our firm on sustainable finance, but also how we mobilize our sustainability efforts as a global institution.• Global Markets launched a Carbon Portfolio Analytics offering within Marquee that provides carbon data, tools, and analytics that empower clients.• Consumer and Wealth Management now offers sustainable investing solutions to clients of all sizes, from our consumer to our ultra-high-net-worth business. In our Private Wealth Management business, demand for sustainable investments has been strongest from our largest clients, and this year we launched an ESG diagnostic to help clients identify and work toward their long-term sustainability goals within their public market portfolios.• Investment Banking continues to deliver holistic services to our clients including integrating ESG into their financing activities through green, social, and sustainability bonds; issuing sustainable KPI-linked issuances; and leveraging equity offerings such as IPOs to enhance and accelerate their sustainability missions. • Asset Management facilitated our recent acquisition of NN Investment Partners, a leading sustainable investment manager in Europe.• Leveraging our OneGS model, we launched a new and unique Decarbonization offering that leverages commercial capabilities and capital solutions across the firm.In the following sections of our 2021 Sustainability Report, we’ll dive deeper into our approach and highlight how we are executing on our strategy across climate transition and inclusive growth.
XXSECTION 2Divider Climate headlineTransition
Executive SummaryAt Goldman Sachs, we are investing resources, capital, and expertise to support the decarbonization of our economy. Solving this complex challenge will require the contributions of many businesses, organizations, governments, and individuals. We belong to a greater ecosystem of efforts, and we must all work together to drive real and meaningful shifts.
We take an integrated approach to prioritizing climate transition and inclusive growth across our business — in our work with clients, through our partnerships, and as a firm. In our efforts to effectively mitigate climate risk and to help accelerate the climate transition required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, we need to actively engage clients, investors, advocacy groups, and multi-stakeholder organizations working to address the pressing issue of climate change. In executing this holistic engagement strategy, we have identified gaps that need to be addressed to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, and we have channeled our resources toward closing them.In this Climate Transition section, we describe how we continue to deliver on our client, partner, and firmwide initiatives to enable and accelerate the global climate transition — bearing in mind that our work is far from done.Sustainability Report 2021Climate Transition | Executive SummaryWe begin Climate Transition by detailing Our Work With Clients across three key priority areas:• Driving Transition focuses on how we support our clients on their decarbonization goals across all sectors and at every stage of their journeys. • Accelerating Innovation outlines how we partner with companies who are developing innovative solutions that help to accelerate transition in critical sectors of the economy.• Mobilizing Capital explains how we use our research, knowledge, and expertise to drive capital and launch commercial products that support clients and investors achieving their climate alignment and net zero goals. In Closing the Gap Through Partnerships, we address our collaborations with other organizations and describe how we’re jointly navigating massive and complex challenges posed by the climate transition — challenges that no institution can solve alone. Lastly, Driving Sustainability in Our Own Business outlines how we are making steady, incremental progress against our net zero and ESG-related goals for our operations and supply chain.
IntroductionAccelerating Climate TransitionAs climate change continues to impact global economies, businesses, and communities across the world, accelerating the transition to a lowcarbon economy is more important than ever. Meeting this challenge will require nothing less than transformative changes across our economy. Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research group estimates that $56 trillion in incremental infrastructure investment is needed to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Our research estimates that half of the decarbonization required is reliant on access to clean power generation and that the decarbonization of transport, buildings, and industry will require a complex ecosystem of low-carbon technologies, including energy storage and carbon capture alongside the supply of clean power. There is also a significant challenge in that in many parts of the world, inexpensive, reliable, and clean energy is not available at scale. In addition to thoughtful public policy that considers the current dynamics of the energy system, we believe that capital markets and innovation will play a critical role in driving a just and orderly global transition — by both supporting these sectors in transition and investing in the necessary technologies and solutions that may not be available at scale today. We acknowledge that achieving decarbonization in the real economy cannot succeed without a global, united effort, which includes supportive public policy and technological advancement.Sustainability Report 2021Climate Transition | Introduction
OUR PURPOSEOur approach to climate is grounded in the areas where we, as a financial institution, can drive the most material impact:ACHIEVING OUR PURPOSEWhat We Do: Our Work With Clients 	How We Do It: Our Firm	How We Address Gaps: Our Partnerships, Engagement, and ImpactAs a financial institution, we believe the most meaningful role we can play in the global climate transition is to drive decarbonization in the real economy, in partnership with our clients. We see significant opportunities to further mobilize the full breadth of our franchise to support this effort. In 2005, Goldman Sachs was one of the first major banks to acknowledge the scale and urgency of climate change with our Environmental Policy Framework. Since then, we have accelerated our efforts to integrate climatefocused efforts across our business. In early 2021, we made a long-term commitment to align our business with a net zero by 2050 pathway, and we shared our roadmap for progress in December, including an initial set of sectoral goals for 2030. As part of this commitment, we have developed a dynamic model to engage our clients throughout their climate transition. We leverage the breadth of resources and capabilities across our business as well as insights and perspectives from our holistic engagement strategy with clients, civil society, and the public sector. By leveraging our experience managing sustainability and climate transition for our own operations, we can better support clients throughout their journeys. Through these efforts, we’ve developed a differentiated view of the market and can identify potential gaps — all with the aim to drive climate solutions for clients and investors through strategic advice, innovative financing tools, partnership on investment, and other commercial products and capabilities.We also recognize that clients in different industries and regions will face different paths in their decarbonization journeys. We are committed to supporting our clients — particularly those in emerging economies that face a more challenging transition — and tailoring sustainability and climate solutions for each client’s unique circumstance.
	 3,000	2.5%Our Work With ClientsAt Goldman Sachs, we leverage our OneGS model to deliver multifaceted client solutions that aim to execute on sustainability commitments. Across teams, divisions, and geographies, we constantly strive to understand the rapidly changing needs of our clients, and we work with them to advocate for comprehensive actions that address today’s pressing need for climate transition while laying the foundation for long-term solutions.We are actively engaging with clients to understand where they are in their journeys and are providing them with guidance, capital, and products curated to their distinct needs — Driving Transition across their businesses.Across our firm, we also work with clients that are at the forefront of Accelerating Innovation, delivering new solutions both within sectors as well as across the broader ecosystem that will be critical as we shift to a low-carbon economy. As we engage across the global economy, we’re also tapping into our analytics and research to identify where, when, and how we can Mobilize Capital and structure unique commercial capabilities and products to drive the greatest impact. Sustainability Report 2021Climate Transition | Introduction
Driving TransitionIn our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report, Accelerating Transition, we shared an interim roadmap for our long-term commitment to align our business with a net zero by 2050 pathway, including an initial set of ranged targets for 2030 across Power, Oil & Gas, and Auto Manufacturing. These represent sectors of the economy where we see the most impactful opportunities to invest in new commercial solutions to drive decarbonization in the real economy through proactive engagement with our clients and deployment of the capital required for transition. Notably, we recognize that the ability for us and our clients to achieve our climate-related goals will depend on a variety of factors, including supportive public policy, technological advancement, and the ambition of clients’ decarbonization commitments.2019 BASELINE AND 2030 TARGETS FOR OUR PRIORITY SECTORSSectorMetrics2019 Baseline2030 Targets% Reduction 2019-30Oil & GasgCO2e / MJ7256-6017%-22%PowerkgCO2e / MWh417147-21948%-65%Auto ManufacturinggCO2e / km15270-7749%-54%As part of our commitment, we have prioritized climate transition in our commercial efforts with clients, leveraging insights from our experience managing climate for our own business and our holistic engagement strategy to develop a comprehensive commercial offering that supports our clients’ low-carbon transition efforts.Fueling Transition-related ProjectsIn addition to public sector support and technological advancement, carbon-intensive industries — such as energy and power — will require significant capital to transition to more carbon-efficient sources. In 2021, we helped accelerate capital flows into energy transition-related projects through innovative structures, including sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs), which enable clients to raise capital in a way that is aligned with their decarbonization goals.Energy:  EniItalian multinational energy company Eni — considered one of the major global energy players — was the first major energy business to publish a Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, affirming its commitment to being fully carbon neutral by 2050 and tying those goals to its financing activity. As joint sustainability structuring agent and joint bookrunner, Goldman Sachs financed the first-ever energy SLB for the company as part of its €1 billion, seven-year commitment. Power:  EnelWorking with Enel, the global energy company and Europe’s largest utility company by market capitalization, provides us with an opportunity to think bigger about driving sustainable global outcomes. In 2020, Goldman Sachs worked with Enel to issue the first bond linked to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Building on that work in 2021, we acted as an active bookrunner on the largest-to-date SLB issuance to help the organization accelerate its sustainability goals. We continue to work with Enel as it builds toward a full range of KPI-linked transactions to help align various financing efforts and activities with its broader sustainability objectives.VistraVistra is an integrated electric power generation and retail company with a diversified generation portfolio, serving more than four million residential, commercial, and industrial customers. By 2030, the company expects to have approximately 90% of its generation capacity comprised of low-to-no carbon-emitting resources. In 2021, we supported the company’s ambition by serving as left lead bookrunner on a $1 billion 7.00% Green Perpetual Preferred Stock offering, the first-ever green perpetual preferred stock issuance for a US corporation. This instrument provides Vistra with capital that achieves rating agency equity credit, and the proceeds will be invested toward a range of sustainability initiatives, including its Vistra Zero zero-carbon generation portfolio.
Driving ESG Product Innovation Through Transaction BankingWe aim to build a smarter and greener treasury — and by partnering with our clients, we support both their sustainability objectives and our own. Our Transaction Banking Services team introduced an innovative product that links yield to ESG goals — complementing our existing suite of ESG-related finance solutions.XylemXylem, a leading water technology company, aims to use 100% process water recycling at all major facilities by 2025. Our Transaction Banking team launched a new ESG-linked Demand Deposit Account — the first of its kind in this space. By linking the yield Xylem earns on its deposits to this recycling goal, the solution encourages the company to focus on its sustainability targets and drive positive outcomes with even broader impact. CLIMATE TRANSITIONAdvancing Toward a Lowercarbon FutureReplacing fossil fuels with lower-carbon alternatives has the potential to make a significant impact on both emissions and energy resource stability. Biofuels, which are widely viewed as lowemitting assets, can help meet increasing energy needs globally. Goldman Sachs has supported a number of transactions geared toward expanding capacity and driving innovation across biofuels development. Restaurant TechnologiesInnovative, sustainable culinary products and processes have moved to the forefront of the restaurant industry, a prime example being the renewable diesel produced from cooking oil. When Restaurant Technologies — the leading provider of cooking oil management and back-of-house hood- and exhaust-cleaning solutions — was set to have a portion of its business acquired by ECP, Goldman Sachs served as financial advisor to Restaurant Technologies and helped the company with positioning the used cooking oil (UCO) portion of its business within the renewable diesel feedstock market landscape. This helped ensure Restaurant Technologies could create an ESG-friendly process of providing recycled cooking oil for its customers.
Decarbonization OfferingWe’ve leaned into helping clients accelerate their climate-related strategies and objectives. In doing so, Goldman Sachs is developing a new and unique cross-firm Decarbonization offering to cover a full suite of tools, delivered through our holistic, differentiated OneGS model. Our aim is a client solution that leverages commercial capabilities and capital solutions across the firm, including Net Zero Advisory, M&A, Financing, Renewable and Alternative Fuels and Energy, Carbon Capture and Sequestration, Commercialization Strategy, and Carbon Offsets. Recognizing that different geographies, industries, and even clients within each industry are at distinct stages of their decarbonization journey, we strive to customize solutions so they’re most relevant to our clients’ unique path to developing project solutions and net zero emissions.As part of a new cross-firm initiative, we spoke with over 150 corporate clients across 12 industry groups on the entire spectrum of decarbonization solutions in 2021.THE DECARBONIZATION JOURNEYStep 1: Measure and PlanUnderstand current climate positioning, performance, and forwardlooking trajectory; set targets and develop plans to achieve them• We leverage our insight as investors to provide an outside-in view on their climate positioning and stated or prospective targets.• We identify ways to accelerate their journey with M&A and strategic investment solutions.Step 2: ReduceReduce Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions from sources owned by the company); Reduce Scope 2 emissions or improve operational efficiency• We leverage and develop green finance for operational investments.• We raise capital and develop solutions for decarbonization and climate transition projects, including greenfield projects as well as brownfield/transition projects.Step 3: ReplaceReplace traditionally consumed power with renewable clean power• As an active player in power and energy certificate markets, Goldman Sachs supports our clients with power risk management and financing solutions. • Our Renewable Power Group provides investment structures for onsite solar and energy storage facilities so clients can make the switch to renewable power.Step 4: Offset“Offset” and neutralize unavoidable or residual emissions• We support our clients with supply, offtake, and financing solutions in the Voluntary Carbon Markets. • We also develop financial solutions for companies investing in or providing offsets, including nature-based carbon offset project platforms focused on localized social benefits and developing bluegreen local economies.Spotlight on Carbon Markets: Our Commercial Framework and Approach  As an important tool to reduce carbon emissions, carbon markets can drive reductions at the most efficient price. By offering solutions within carbon markets as part of our crossfirm Decarbonization offering, Goldman Sachs can help to better position industries and clients for continued progress in their climate transition journey.For more than 10 years, Goldman Sachs has been active in major compliance carbon markets, such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the California Cap and Trade Program. We are also active in the growing global voluntary carbon offset market — and within several industry and advisory bodies. For example, we are members of the “Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets,” a private sector-led initiative working to scale an effective and efficient voluntary carbon market to help meet the  Paris Agreement goals. Within the compliance and voluntary carbon markets, we offer a variety of trading, financing,  and risk management solutions to help corporates and investors manage their carbon exposure and meet their sustainability goals.Setting the Scene: Carbon Pricing Initiatives on the Rise Carbon pricing initiatives, of which there are more than 60 globally, are an important tool to achieve the emission reduction ambitions under the Paris Agreement. We believe that a global carbon price can serve as a critical path to advancing global net zero ambitions by incentivizing technological innovation and progress in decarbonization technologies. While carbon pricing and taxes can be an effective policy instrument, market-based mechanisms allow the supply and demand for carbon allowances — or credits — to determine the price of carbon. These voluntary markets can effectively aim to drive finance to activities that reduce emissions.DYNAMICS AND CHALLENGES OF A NASCENT VOLUNTARY CARBON MARKETMarket Demand for Carbon OffsetsCarbon offset demand has increased significantly in the past few years on the back of a rapid expansion in corporate sustainability commitments. However, compared to compliance markets, the voluntary market is still quite small, with current annual trading volumes amounting to around $1 billion1 compared to roughly $750 billion annually in the EU ETS2.Demand-Side TrendsAs corporates set net zero or carbon neutrality targets and increase their sustainability commitments, the demand has increased for carbon offsets. Supply-Side Trends: Obstacles for GrowthCarbon offsets supply remains fragmented due to a wide range of project types and a number of independent standards and associated registries. Registries play an important role in the voluntary carbon market by dictating which methodologies are viable for assessing a carbon offset project, issuing the actual credits, and keeping track of credit ownership. 1—Ecosystem Marketplace: “State of the Voluntary Carbon Markets 2021,” September 2021.2—Anders Nordeng, Refinitiv: “Carbon trading: exponential growth on record high,” February 2022.Our Involvement in Carbon Markets Advocacy Work Goldman Sachs served on a private sector-led task force aimed at scaling global voluntary carbon markets to help meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets — launched by Mark Carney, UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and finance advisor to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for COP26 — is sponsored by the Institute of International Finance. The task force published its blueprint on creating a largescale, transparent carbon credit trading market in January 2021. The blueprint included 20 comprehensive and tangible actions, as well as a roadmap for implementing a highquality, high-integrity voluntary carbon market at pace and scale.Looking Ahead: Additional Learnings from Offset Sourcing Initiatives  The availability of carbon offsets from certain projects, particularly nature or technology projects that remove CO2, is limited. In response, Global Markets has issued requests for removal project proposals that can address client interest in the market as well as meet the firm’s own net zero objectives in offsetting its operational emissions. 
Active Engagement With Our Clients, Investors, and Portfolio Companies on Climate TransitionWe strive to support both clients and companies that we invest in with the resources and knowledge they need to make progress on their climate transition journey, and we actively engage with companies to help drive best practices.Goldman Sachs Asset Management Stewardship Our Global Stewardship Team seeks to promote best practices in ESG and corporate governance at portfolio companies through proxy voting, direct engagement,  and industry collaboration.Engaging Next-Generation Investors on Climate In Consumer and Wealth Management, our Client Engagement Team hosted an event called the Next Gen Change Makers program, highlighting the many ways clients can make a difference in their local communities and across Examples of the Global Stewardship Team’s initiatives on climate transition include: • Using Proxy Voting and Engagement to Improve Disclosure of Material Emissions Data  In 2022, we updated our proxy voting policy to vote against directors at companies not disclosing greenhouse gas emissions considered material to their business. Since October 2020, we have engaged either directly or via letter with 271 companies to encourage disclosure of material emissions data, and through these efforts we aim to push for greater transparency at these companies.• Encouraging Targets to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions  We have identified companies across our portfolios that have not yet disclosed a target to reduce emissions, and we seek to engage with these companies to set and disclose targets to reduce GHG emissions.• Managing Risks Related to Biodiversity  We are engaging with a targeted group of highimpact companies to understand their approach to key issues such as plastics, packaging and waste, and responsible land use while promoting accountability and best practices. the globe. This year’s topic was “Accelerating the Climate Transition,” and both industry experts and Goldman Sachs specialists joined to discuss how consumer behavior, impact investing, and philanthropy can help drive change in sectors like clean energy, sustainable food and agriculture, and waste and ecosystem services.For more information on how Goldman Sachs Asset Management  engages with hundreds of companies around the world, please review  our Stewardship Report. Accelerating Innovation
The level of effort required to enact systemic change extends beyond any one business, organization, government, NGO, or individual. We must work together, using our respective insights, innovation potential, and perspectives to connect points of leverage so that we’re collectively driving real and meaningful shifts at the system level. While we know that driving change in the short term is a critical input to mitigating the impact of a changing climate, we also take an expansive view — leveraging our resources and financial expertise to help scale emerging innovation across sectors that will be critical to driving economywide decarbonization efforts. We support companies that face unique transition-related challenges today, while also supporting emerging markets and sectors that are evolving the way business will be done in the future.
Electrification Value ChainCatalyzing decarbonization across industries will require not only changes at the company level but also at the system level. We’ve seen firsthand this potential for system-level change through our work activating the full life cycle of electrification. In the US, the transportation sector generates the largest portion of greenhouse gas emissions at 29%. Not only can vehicle electrification significantly reduce emissions output, but it can also encourage technological innovation through critical areas of vehicle development, such as batteries and charging networks.  Goldman Sachs supports this technology innovation and development at every stage of the value chain — from helping automakers access key metals and manage price risk in production, to advising on acquisitions for emerging electric vehicle (EV) charging network operators, to financing the rapid growth of next-generation battery manufacturers. 
 Price Risk Management: Metals 	Through the direct efforts of our Global Markets Commodities team, Goldman Sachs supports the auto industry in shifting production toward EVs and making them economically viable. We develop risk management strategies for key raw materials — or refined metals — and for batteries, which have a commodity price that can account for 30% of the production cost. Our products allow automakers to mitigate price risks through financial and physical hedging, and we include solutions to streamline  sourcing of metals.  Battery Manufacturing: Northvolt“The future of fleets is electric. Adding ViriCiti’s vehicle management capabilities to our fleet portfolio … underscores the importance of software to EV charging and will ensure operational readiness at low cost as fleets of all types across North America and Europe continue to electrify.” PASQUALE ROMANOPresident and CEO, ChargePointFinancing Micro-Mobility with TIER Goldman Sachs helped TIER, the European micro-mobility leader, raise $60 million to directly deploy e-scooters and its network of batterycharging stations last year. One-third of TIER’s trips replace a car ride1, with the potential to avoid ~14 kilotons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere. TIER’s new scooters also contain several hardware improvements, such as swappable batteries, that improve their energy efficiency and result in reduced emissions per trip.1—YouGov study; SFMTA (2019): San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. Powered Scooter Share Mid-Pilot Evaluation.	29Our Asset Management group has co-led the last three equity financing rounds for Northvolt AB, the leading independent sustainable lithium ion battery cell supplier in Europe, totaling over $1.6 billion of investment in the company. Northvolt has been able to accelerate its plans to expand manufacturing and reach true scale while bringing sustainable batteries to the automotive and energy storage industries. Charging Networks: ChargePointWe acted as exclusive financial advisor to ChargePoint, a leading EV charging network operating in North America and Europe, during its acquisition of ViriCiti, a provider of electrification for eBus and commercial vehicles. The acquisition accelerates ChargePoint’s electrification of fleets and resulted in the creation of a combined charging-telematics solution designed to ensure operational readiness at a low cost.Battery Materials: Redwood MaterialsThe transition to EVs will require increased battery recycling capacity as well as a rapid increase in battery materials production capacity in the US and Europe. To meet demand, Redwood Materials is recycling batteries, optimizing battery materials, and designing recycling programs and collaborations with both Ford and Volvo. Our Asset Management group invested in Redwood’s Series C equity round in 2021, helping to accelerate their development and further driving the transition to electric vehicles.
Next Phase of RenewablesAccelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will require innovative solutions that catalyze not only renewable energy generation but also improvements in energy efficiency and storage, as well as grid services to shift to a clean energy future. We work with our clients to develop market-based, commercially viable solutions as we look to unlock the next phase of rapid renewable expansion. Marin Clean EnergyIn 2021, Goldman Sachs executed its first renewable energy prepay transaction with Marin Clean Energy (MCE), leveraging our expertise in municipal prepays and renewables to adapt a transaction structure commonly used to procure natural gas and apply it to enable savings in the procurement of clean energy. This approach will help lower MCE’s procurement costs for existing renewable power purchase agreements over the next six years and is expected to lower energy costs by more than $14 million for the more than one million residents and businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area served by MCE. HydrostorEnergy storage is a key enabler to continued renewable energy penetration on the power grid. The existing energy grid requires significant advancement to add more renewable power to the system. Through a preferred equity financing commitment, our Asset Management group committed to invest $250 million in Hydrostor Inc., a long-duration energy technology company. The company is developing Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) technology targeting the growing long-duration energy storage market globally. With A-CAES, Hydrostor leverages existing industrial equipment with established supply chains to evolve the energy grid.Energy VaultGoldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Energy Vault in its $1.1 billion merger with Novus Capital Corporation II to become a public company. Energy Vault is a creator of gravitybased, grid-scale energy storage solutions that recycle waste products like coal ash and glass fibers from retired wind turbine blades into energy storage. These solutions are key to building needed energy storage infrastructure at locations where lithium battery storage or pumped-storage hydropower may not be feasible.
GridLiance and NextEra Energy TransmissionAs a company that’s well-positioned to benefit from the substantial expected renewables growth over the coming years, GridLiance’s core business model is to partner with electric cooperatives, public power, and others to plan for the future of the grid — and invest in transmission infrastructure while improving grid reliability. NextEra Energy Transmission develops, finances, constructs, operates, and maintains transmission assets across North America, and it operates through its regional subsidiaries to integrate renewable energy and strengthen the electric grid. Together, these two companies can unlock opportunities for the next generation of energy creation and delivery. Goldman Sachs served as exclusive financial advisor to Blackstone in its sale of GridLiance to NextEra Energy Transmission for $660 million — including the assumption of debt — which furthered NextEra’s goal to create America’s leading competitive transmission company.Sabre IndustriesWhen it comes to planning infrastructure that enables the future of the grid, Sabre is focused on providing highly engineered, mission-critical overhead steel poles, towers, battery storage solutions, and related services for electrical utility and telecom end markets. Sabre Industries’ work is key to modernizing and strengthening the US electrical transmission and distribution grid, safely and efficiently interconnecting rapidly growing renewable generation capacity and battery storage facilities, and expanding 4G and 5G wireless telecom infrastructure for enhanced network reliability and connectivity. In 2021, Goldman Reliance IndustriesIn October 2021, Goldman Sachs acted as an exclusive financial advisor to Reliance Industries on Reliance New Energy Solar’s acquisition of REC Solar Holdings for an enterprise value of $771 million. REC Solar will be a key part of Reliance’s new energy vision to become a global-scale photovoltaic manufacturing player with industry-leading heterojunction cell technology. The acquisition of REC Solar will help equip Reliance with a ready global platform and the opportunity to expand and grow in key green energy markets globally, including in the US, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere in Asia.Capital Markets Innovation: Building a $1 Billion+ Renewables Business in JapanIn the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident, the Japanese government overhauled its energy policy and implemented a new renewables law to stimulate the Japanese renewables sector. To support that initiative, Goldman Sachs adapted the Green Project Bond Structure used in other countries to Japan’s renewable energy sector in 2013. This helped to provide quality debt financing to non-traditional renewables developers — many of whom did not have a long-standing relationship with Japanese banks. We are proud to have supported a significant contribution to renewables deployment in Japan by having arranged an over JPY100 billion bond issuance for 86 renewable power facilities with a cumulative capacity of 338.9 megawatts. Today — more than ten years after the Fukushima accident — Japan has become a world leader in renewables deployment.
Sachs provided financing of $1 billion to Blackstone Energy Partners in its acquisition of Sabre Industries, continuing Blackstone’s focus on investing in companies that support the transition to cleaner, more affordable energy. In addition, Goldman Sachs served as sole arranger on Canadian Solar’s JPY8.1 billion ($75 million) green project bond that combines a dual tenor structure with a multiasset cross-collateralization scheme to finance three solar projects in Japan, with a peak combined generating capacity of 43MW. The bond was awarded the highest “Green 1” rating under the Japanese Green Bond guidelines by the Japan Credit Rating Agency and also won green Project Bond of the Year as part of Environmental Finance’s Bond Awards 2022.Waste and MaterialsWe believe that advancements in waste and material management will promote sustainable production and consumption, support increased resource efficiency, and drive commercial success. OikosWhen Goldman Sachs acquired a majority stake in Oikos — Germany’s second-largest provider of high-quality prefabricated homes — in May 2021, we embarked on a journey toward further accelerating the decarbonization of the housing industry. While traditional brick and mortar homes can cause significant environmental cost and GHG emissions during production, Oikos’ homes are made from environmentally friendly materials with the goal of resulting in lower emissions. Oikos also has a strong sustainability focus along its entire value chain. We helped the company identify numerous initiatives that fully align with the goals in the Paris Agreement — including phasing out diesel-powered production vehicles, investing in new heating systems, installing solar photovoltaic systems on its plants, and extending the environmental commitment along the supply chain through purchasing FSC/PEFC-certified timber from responsibly managed forests.Oikos is accelerating decarbonization in the housing industry with approximately 99% lower CO2/sqm emissions over traditional houses and approximately 80%–90% environmental cost advantage.TemperPackGoldman Sachs Asset Management invested in TemperPack, a leading manufacturer of sustainable thermal insulation for cold chain packaging. The new funding will expand TemperPack’s capacity for protective materials technologies, grow its geographic footprint, and extend its customer reach — helping to keep plastic waste out of the environment and reduce carbon emissions.Sustainable Food and AgricultureFood and agricultural production drives a significant portion of global emissions today and it is critical to shift to more sustainable global production practices. Our work increases value across the full supply chain — from agricultural production through storage, processing, and distribution — and improves environmental quality control to enable more sustainable outcomes, from farm to table.Miyoko’sMiyoko’s Creamery Inc. is a leading plant milk creamery with artisanal, fermented plant-based butter and cheeses that are loved by chefs, foodies, and consumers. Miyoko’s is a market leader within alternative dairy and has an established presence in the natural retail channel, with efforts underway to expand into conventional (Target, Publix, Walmart), club (Costco), and food service. The company’s mission is to reduce the planetary impact of the human diet through a shift to plant-based foods, which have a significantly lower carbon footprint and require less water relative to animal protein. With their products, the company is also dedicated to reducing the number of animals inhumanely used in our global food system. To support their goals, Goldman Sachs Asset Management invested $12.5 million into Miyoko’s in July 2021 as part of the company’s $40 million Series C financing.Nature’s FyndNature’s Fynd, a food technology company, has developed a new protein that is highly nutritious and contains 51% protein by dry mass and all 20 amino acids used by the human body. The protein’s structure is versatile, which allows it to be manufactured into different form factors across meat and dairy. Nature’s Fynd’s protein production is more resourceefficient than that of other proteins, such as soy and pea isolates, with a lower cost at scale, enabling it to produce the protein with a fraction of the land (99% less) and water (99% less) that meat production requires.
Mobilizing CapitalTo transition to a low-carbon economy, an estimated $100 trillion to $150 trillion? in capital will be required to decarbonize the hardest-to-abate sectors over the next three decades.To support this work, we tap research and analytics tools and teams from across the firm to inform our decisions and our approach to engaging with clients. We also create new products and services across a full range of asset classes to provide differentiated, performancedriven strategies that fit each client’s needs.1—Global Financial Markets Association and Boston Consulting Group:“Climate Finance Markets and the Real Economy,” December 2020.GS SUSTAIN provides a mosaic-based approach to assessing ESG under five principal areas: Governance, Operational Environmental and Social Performance, Product Alignment, Controversies, and ESG Fund Holdings.

CarbonomicsTo guide clients through their transition to a net zero economy, we need to understand the economics that shape it. Carbonomics is Goldman Sachs’ GIR’s flagship research series that focuses on the economics of decarbonization and sustainable growth.Carbonomics’s — “Introducing the GS Net Zero Carbon Models and Sector Frameworks”• A global transition to net zero will require decarbonization across multiple industries and sectors, with existing and emerging clean technologies playing a critical role in driving the pace of decarbonization. In this report, Goldman Sachs Research presents modeling for two paths to net zero carbon, with two global models of decarbonization by sector and technology, leveraging the team’s proprietary Carbonomics cost curve. The report finds a wide range of investment opportunities associated with what GIR believes are the key infrastructure milestones required to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, with an expectation for a cumulative $56 trillion of green infrastructure investments to reach net zero, encompassing >2% of GDP by 2032.• GIR also translates its global net zero models into pathways for emission intensity reduction for 30 key emitting corporate industries, providing alternative energy transition scenarios for investors and corporates to leverage.Carbonomics’s — The Clean Hydrogen Revolution• GIR believes it is now time to revisit the clean hydrogen theme as policy, affordability, and scalability seem to be converging to create unprecedented momentum for the clean hydrogen economy. In this report, GIR analyzes  this critical pillar to any aspiring net zero path, aiding the decarbonization of around 15% of global GHG emissions, with an estimated $5.0 trillion worth of cumulative investments required in the clean hydrogen supply chain. The report highlights that clean hydrogen can develop into a major global market, impacting geopolitical patterns in energy supply, and examines the case for international trade, concluding that 30% of global hydrogen volumes have the potential to be involved in cross-border transport, with the total addressable market for hydrogen generation alone having the potential to double to around $250 billion by 2030 and reach over $1 trillion by 2050.On November 16, 2021, we hosted our second Carbonomics: The Green Engine of Economic Recovery Conference virtually from London. With more than 6,000 registered attendees, the conference provided a platform for 40 CEOs of leading corporates as well as key policymakers to speak on their strategies for delivering sustainable growth across key global industries.MarqueeAccess to data is critical for investors to make sustainable investment decisions. Marquee — Goldman Sachs’ digital marketplace for our institutional investor clients — delivers unparalleled, cross-asset access to global markets.

We are committed to developing products and solutions that help our clients and investors capitalize on the opportunities presented by these changes.Bloomberg Goldman Sachs Clean Energy Equity Index In February 2021, our Asset Management group and Bloomberg launched a clean energy equity index, building on the strength of our partnership to direct capital and utilize data in the fight against climate change. We jointly recognize the significant global investments necessary for decarbonization — coupled with declining renewable energy costs and ever-increasing technologies for renewable energy. We developed the index using a proprietary approach informed by insights from BloombergNEF (BNEF) analysts, who identify companies that are active and impactful in their respective sectors as well as assess their exposure to clean energy. This data-driven approach selects securities from the broader Bloomberg World Index, based on BNEF estimates of a company’s value attributable to its activities across the clean energy themes of wind energy, energy storage, clean power, networks, digitalization, bioenergy, solar energy, and hydrogen energy. Global Environmental Impact Strategy  Goldman Sachs Asset Management has developed an investment product that seeks to keep investors on the right side of disruption by moving beyond backward-looking benchmarks to identify innovative, attractively valued companies aligned with durable secular growth themes. The product in the US focuses on companies that seek to provide solutions to environmental problems aligned with five key themes: clean energy, resource efficiency, sustainable consumption, the circular economy, and water sustainability. Global thematic environmental equity-focused strategies topped $1 billion AUS in 2021.
ActiveBeta® Paris-Aligned US Large Cap Equity Strategy  Goldman Sachs Asset Management has launched a Parisaligned investment strategy that seeks to align with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement to combat climate change and its effects. The purpose of our Paris-aligned investment approach is to decarbonize public equity investment portfolios and increase investment in climate solutions in a way that is consistent with a 1.5°C net zero emissions future, in line with the stated goals of the Paris Agreement. The strategy supports many investors’ growing desire to reduce carbon emissions and more deliberately manage the transition to a low-carbon economy through our rules-based and transparent approach.Just Climate  In October 2021, Goldman Sachs Asset Management Imprint (“Imprint”) announced its strategic partnership with Generation IM in the foundation of Just Climate. The mission of Just Climate is to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C by catalyzing and scaling capital toward the most impactful climate solutions. Our Asset Management group served as a founding strategic partner in Just Climate alongside Microsoft Climate Innovation and Development Fund, Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), IMAS Foundation, and Harvard Management Company.Structured Notes Issuance  Our structured note issuance in the sustainable space has risen by more than 50% in the past year, with demand continuing to grow as retail investors become increasingly concerned with integrating ESG into their financial investments on indices that can filter and reflect ESG considerations. French accounts led the European demand for products linked to third-party ESG indices, and we’re starting to gauge growing interest from the APAC region. While sector exclusions and absolute scores remain popular, there has been a wider variety of approaches used by clients as they seek out improvers in this space. To help meet the increasing demand for environmental and climaterelated products, S&P launched a range of indices that were exclusive to Goldman Sachs and designed to meet Paris Aligned Benchmark and Climate Aligned Benchmark requirements.NN Investment Partners Goldman Sachs announced the completion of the acquisition of NN Investment Partners from NN Group N.V. for €1.7 billion. With a heritage dating back almost 175 years, NN Investment Partners is a leading sustainable investment manager in Europe. NN Investment Partners will be integrated into Goldman Sachs Asset Management with the company’s more than 900 professionals joining the Goldman Sachs family. The Netherlands is now an important location in Goldman Sachs’ European business and a center of excellence for sustainability in public markets investing. The acquisition brings Goldman Sachs’ assets under supervision to approximately $2.8 trillion1 and affirms its position as a top five active asset manager globally with leading franchises in fixed income, liquidity, equities, alternatives and insurance asset management. NN Investment Partners has been successful in incorporating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors across its product range, with ESG criteria integrated into approximately 90% of assets under supervision2. Over time, Goldman Sachs Asset Management intends to leverage the expertise of NN Investment Partners to complement its existing investment processes, helping the firm to deepen ESG integration across its product range and deliver on clients’ sustainable investing priorities.1—All data as of December 2021.2—NN Group: “N.V.

We are excited to welcome the talented team at NN Investment Partners, a center of excellence in sustainable investing, to Goldman Sachs and together we will focus on delivering long-term value to our clients and shareholders.”DAVID SOLOMONChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Closing the Gap Through PartnershipsThe climate challenge is complex and cannot be addressed by any one firm alone. This reality requires partnership, which is why we consistently engage external stakeholders and establish strategic partnerships with other organizations to complement our work with clients. In particular, we look to work collaboratively with partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own, such as in regional and emerging markets where there may be varying paths to climate transition.Driving Sustainable Growth in Emerging Markets Through PartnershipsGoldman Sachs 	36 Emerging markets are critical to the overall transition to a net zero future. In the past 10 years, annual global energy transition investment notably increased, from $290 billion in 2011 to $501 billion in 2020. While emerging markets accounted for an increasingly large share of global investment, high-income economies have been pulling ahead in recent years, with high-income markets recording a 24% year-on-year increase in investment, while emerging markets experienced a 21% contraction in 20201. We are firmly committed to leveraging our position to drive capital toward regions of the world that have the greatest need, and we are looking for ways to alleviate the financial burden of moving from high-carbon to more sustainable economic solutions.From engagement with external stakeholders to collaborative program development and philanthropic initiatives, we leverage our full toolkit to identify and support growth and opportunity in these areas, creating a wide range of cascading solutions.Among the world’s emerging and regional markets, Asia has tremendous potential for decarbonization but requires the heaviest level of outside investment. According to the Global Sustainability Report 2021Financial Markets Association (GFMA) report Climate Finance Markets and the Real Economy, demand for resources and capital in Asia is estimated at $66 trillion — 55% of the total investment required for a complete global climate transition. The largest investment need by sector is for electrification of technologies and processes and the corresponding switch from fossil fuel-based power to renewable power. To achieve this, we need clean energy investment to reach five to eight times the amount of current levels.A lack of urgent action today will result in significantly higher need for climate adaptation and mitigation investments tomorrow. The need is clear: we need more investment, at a faster pace, in emerging markets, such as South and Southeast Asia. We believe that regional partnerships are key to achieving this goal.1—Climate Finance Leadership Initiative: “Unlocking Private Climate Finance in Emerging Markets,” April 2021.
Climate Transition | Closing the Gap Through PartnershipsThe Climate Innovation and Development Fund With Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  Last April, we announced the Bloomberg Philanthropies and Goldman Sachs Climate Finance partnership in an effort to drive more capital and develop tools that equip investors to accelerate climate transition and address the needs in emerging markets, such as Asia.Together with the ADB, we launched the Climate Innovation and Development Fund to deploy capital and catalyze investment in clean energy projects across South and Southeast Asia, with a special focus on India and Vietnam. Structured as a blended financing facility, the fund is seeded with $25 million of grant capital and has the potential to unlock up to $500 million in private-sector and governmental investments in critical solutions to accelerate technologies and markets for a net zero future. “India and Vietnam are dynamic and growing markets, and both have the potential to lead the way in the global fight against climate change. This fund will give them access to the capital and direct investment they need to do just that, and I’m looking forward to working with our partners at Goldman Sachs and the Asian Development Bank as we expand our efforts in the region and help other countries do the same.”MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERGFounder, Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg PhilanthropiesManaged by the ADB, the fund will target projects with direct, measurable, and positive climate-related outcomes, including clean energy systems, sustainable transportation, and energy efficiency.Sustainability Report 2021	Climate Transition | Closing the Gap Through Partnerships	38Meeting the Net Zero Challenge in AsiaAs part of a special miniseries on Exchanges at Goldman Sachs, Accelerating Transition, Goldman Sachs Global Head of Climate Strategy Kara Mangone spoke with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Vice President Ahmed Saeed about a unique effort that connects public and private sectors to leverage capital to accelerate the transition to a net zero future in Asia.
KM:	What are the key priorities for the Asian Development Bank? What are your top strategic priorities today? AS:	We’re working with governments to provide them with the financing they need to do the things they must around building sustainable infrastructure and around mitigation and adaptation planning in a number of different ways. But those sums will simply not be achievable through the public sector alone, and we need the private sector to step up in a big way. Our role as we see it in that process is to become a better collaborator and partner. KM:	What does this partnership look like for you?  AS:	Firstly, the fact that the private sector needs to act doesn’t mean that the private sector has all the tools it needs at its disposal. In particular, the interface with government is absolutely critical. And so multilateral development banks have a very unique role to play in helping the private sector engage government. … The Climate Innovation and Development Fund with Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs is one example of a very high-impact collaborative model. Sustainability Report 2021KM:AS:One of the solutions is going to be pulling together different sources of capital — how do you see this playing out in markets?  Decarbonization is development. The single greatest opportunity that countries in Asia and elsewhere in the world will find to mobilize capital — and capital married to skills and technology to come into their countries — is going to be around decarbonization agendas. I really think the biggest opportunity in emerging markets is to pivot from a conversation that this is a price to be paid to a dialogue that says, “Wow, this is an unbelievable opportunity to improve the livelihoods of people.” And I think it happens to be true.

Climate Transition | Meeting the Net Zero Challenge in AsiaDriving Sustainability in Our Own BusinessOur Net Zero Journey: Incremental Progress
Early last year and in conjunction with the announcement of our long-term commitment to align our financing activities with a net zero by 2050 pathway, we expanded our operational carbon neutrality commitment with a goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions in our operations and supply chain by 2030. Our net zero carbon strategy focuses on five key areas across our operations and supply chain. These five key areas include increasing energy efficiency in our buildings, sourcing renewable energy, engaging with our vendors, encouraging behavior change among our people, and purchasing carbon offsets for the emissions that we cannot reduce.Increasing energy efficiency in our buildings is paramount to our net zero journey. To do this, we have continued to focus on reducing our energy consumption through LEED certified smart building design and upgrading equipment to maintain ongoing operational efficiency. We also continue to source renewable energy for 100% of our electricity use. In the past year, we signed long-term solar power purchase agreements, which will position us to achieve our 2025 target of sourcing 80% of our renewable energy from longterm, impactful agreements. Engaging with our vendors is an important step in addressing Scope 3 supply chain emissions and is critical to achieving our 2030 net zero carbon commitment. In 2021, to facilitate dialogue with our vendors around their own emissions management programs, we joined CDP Supply Chain as a lead member. Through this program, we engaged with vendors representing a majority of our supply chain emissions to gain a better understanding of their GHG emissions and climate actions. We also integrated standard climate-related RFP and vendor assessment questions in our sourcing and vendor review processes. Combined, this information will allow us to build further dialogue with our vendors to support and catalyze their own decarbonization journeys. Supporting behavior change among our people will contribute to reducing our firm’s emissions footprint by making more sustainable choices in how we work and travel. In Bengaluru, we introduced 40 electric vehicles to our employee commutation program, and we plan to increase this to 150 in the coming year. As part of a developing Green Traveler program, we are exploring ways to provide increased internal transparency on business travel and commuting impacts, which will help our people understand how their actions can support our efforts. We also recognize that a portion of our journey to net zero will require investments in carbon removal offsets to neutralize the emissions we are unable to eliminate through the four strategies above. This has presented an opportunity to partner with our financing and global markets groups to explore carbon removal projects and bring new solutions to the market that we and our clients can leverage.With an increase in corporate net zero commitments over the last year, demand for carbon removal has risen faster than existing projects can supply. Through collaboration, we hope to support the nascent carbon project market challenges by connecting corporate needs and available capital, while navigating developing standards, regulations, and transparency. 
Progress Toward Our 2025 GoalsIn December 2019, we established a set of 2025 ESG targets with the aim of minimizing the environmental impact of our operations, while enabling collaborative partnerships that help us to drive market transformation.PROGRESS TOWARD 2025 ESG AND NET ZERO COMMITMENTSCategory2021 Status2025 GoalCarbon, Energy, and Business TravelReduce energy intensity by 20% from a 2017 baseline for offices under operational control-36%-20%Establish a Green Traveler program for Goldman Sachs employees to minimize the environmental impact of business travelIn progressWaterAchieve 20% reduction in water use for all new construction and major renovation projectsIn progressReduce water intensity by 15% from a 2017 baseline for offices under operational control-47%-15%PlasticsRemove 100% of plastic beverage bottles and disposables from onsite cafeterias, micro-markets, and vending machines globallyIn progress100%Reduce the amount of firm-provided office supplies that contain plasticIn progressSourcingReduce internal paper use per-capita by 30% from a 2017 baseline-79%-30%Events/HospitalityProcure 100% green cleaning products for on-site cafeterias globally40%100%Procure 50% sustainably sourced food for on-site cafeterias globally21%50%Supply ChainAssess 100% of global vendors for ESG risks60%100%Increase spending with diverse vendors by 50% from a 2020 baseline26%50%	 Already met or exceeded commitment	 On track to meet commitmentProgress Toward Our 2025 Goals2021 is the first year for reporting progress toward our efforts. While COVID-19 continued to have an impact on our operations and supply chain during the last year, we remained focused on our commitments.
• We increased our efforts to advance smarter sourcing choices for the cleaning products used in our offices and the food offered in our cafeterias. Currently, 40% of our cleaning products and 21% of our food are sustainably sourced. These products are either certified by an approved standard or meet outlined criteria to be classified as environmentally preferred. We are continuing to work with key vendors toward meeting our commitment of 100% green cleaning products and 50% sustainably sourced food by 2025. • We continue to progress our strategy to remove 100% of plastic beverage bottles and disposables from onsite cafeterias, micro-markets, and vending machines globally, as well as reduce the amount of firm-provided office supplies that contain plastic by 2025. Over the past year, we have reverted to compostable disposables in our offices following a temporary hiatus in 2020 due to health concerns and supply chain challenges.• With many employees working from home in 2020 and 2021, we achieved a 79% reduction per-capita on our internal paper use, far exceeding our 30% reduction target. We will continue to monitor paper use in offices as our staff fully returns to offices.• In 2021, the energy and water intensity of our offices decreased by 36% and 42%, respectively, from a 2017 baseline. As a result, we have already exceeded our energy intensity target of 20% reduction and our water intensity target of 15% reduction by 2025. We will be closely monitoring performance of these metrics as staff fully returns to our offices. • We continue to procure 100% renewable energy for all of our global electricity consumption — and work toward our commitment to have 80% of this from long-term contracts. • We continue to maintain carbon neutrality for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 business travel emissions, and we neutralized these emissions through a combination of carbon removal and avoidance offset credits. We intend to continue working with our investment team to increase our sourcing of carbon removal credits each year as we work toward phasing out carbon avoidance offsets by 2030. • Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased by 60% from 2020 to 2021 but are 25% lower than our 2017 baseline. This year-over-year change reflects an increase in activity as our people began to return to offices, and challenges in sourcing market-matched renewable energy in certain locations, specifically Singapore. We continue to seek opportunities for further reductions. • As of 2021, 74% of our global square footage has been LEED certified. All newly certified facilities are LEED Gold or equivalent, with the exception of two LEED Silver certified properties that had leases signed prior to 2021. Also, 100% of our facilities continue to be ISO 14001 certified, and all our on-site events continue to be 100% ISO 20121 certified.Sustainable Supply Chain Management Last year, we further enhanced our ESG requirements and controls within both our sourcing and ongoing vendor management processes, developing a suite of ESG standards for all vendors to meet. We made significant progress toward our commitment to assess 100% of vendors for ESG risk, with new risk screening criteria embedded into our vendor management platform, with the aim of identifying vendors with higher inherent ESG risks. This in turn enabled us to conduct deeper ESG assessments focused on our vendors’ controls to prevent environmental, modern slavery, and human trafficking issues.We continue to educate our vendor managers and sourcing professionals on the issue of modern slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain. Last year we invited nonprofit Hope.Inspire.Love to speak to our sourcing teams and provide a better understanding of human trafficking issues in the US, including how to spot the signs of human trafficking and how to take action against it. This year, we will continue to partner with organizations at the forefront of these issues to educate and raise awareness. 
Looking Ahead: Climate Change and Biodiversity The climate challenge is complex and will require transformative change across our economy to both mitigate further global warming and establish measures to protect the most vulnerable from the impacts we’re already seeing. Our interim roadmap for net zero and 2030 sectoral targets are a key step forward in our journey to align our financing portfolio to a net zero pathway by 2050. Our initial focus is on building our infrastructure to increase efficiency and scalability of carbon intensity analysis to support our clients’ decarbonization efforts. Over time, we plan to further embed these targets into our business practices and risk management framework — and expand our target-setting framework to include additional sectors that are important to our financing portfolio. As we look forward, our climate commitment extends beyond our long-term net zero pledge. Biodiversity is just one area where we see growing interest from clients, investors, and broader stakeholders from both a risk and opportunity perspective.Forests are critical for the environment and provide livelihoods for people across the world. They also act as carbon sinks, sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Deforestation and degradation of forests remain significant challenges in many regions — and both are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the ocean constitutes the vast majority of habitable space on our planet and contains a significant portion of the world’s biodiversity. The ocean is critical to the functioning of our planet, as this natural resource absorbs carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere. Ocean biodiversity is also a crucial source of income for many communities around the world, and the effects of climate change on ocean biodiversity will have economic impacts around the world. Sustainability Report 2021Climate Transition | Looking Ahead
In addition to supporting the health of communities and the planet, nature and biodiversity have significant economic value and are important to driving sustainable growth:• According to the World Economic Forum, more than half of the world’s GDP, $44 trillion of economic value generation, is highly or moderately dependent on nature.• The World Economic Forum also reports that, together, the three largest sectors that are highly dependent on nature generate close to $8 trillion of gross value added (GVA): construction ($4 trillion), agriculture ($2.5 trillion), and food and beverages ($1.4 trillion)1.For these reasons, Goldman Sachs remains committed to the global effort to protect the world’s forests and oceans and seeks to act responsibly when financing or investing in companies or projects in sectors that have potential impact on nature and biodiversity across both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Goldman Sachs has a long history of protecting nature and biodiversity, from our conservation efforts establishing the Karukinka preserve in Tierra del Fuego to our recent work Sustainability Report 2021Climate Transition | Looking Aheadwith the Conservation Fund. We recognize the importance of critical natural habitats that have high biodiversity value and include areas that are under legal or proposed government protection. We have established related environmental and social risk guidelines as part of our firmwide transactional due diligence process, and we have committed to forgo financing any projects or initiating loans where proceeds would significantly convert or degrade a critical natural habitat.Goldman Sachs is also a member of the forum for the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), a new market-led initiative that aims to develop a risk management and disclosure framework for organizations to report and act on evolving nature-related risks and help shift global financial flows toward nature-positive outcomes. Building on the momentum of the Taskforce on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, we believe that quality, reliable information on biodiversity and naturerelated impacts, facilitated by better disclosure, will allow corporations and financial institutions to better understand and measure nature-related impacts and ultimately incorporate nature-related risks and opportunities into strategic planning and risk management.1—World Economic Forum: “Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy,” January 2020.

Executive SummaryWe recognize that growth that is not inclusive is not sustainable. In Inclusive Growth, we explore the challenges of creating a more inclusive, equitable society through our work across the firm. As with the complexity of a transition to a low-carbon economy, advancing inclusive growth cannot be solved by a single policy or single financial institution. Our approach combines experience, learnings from listening to the needs of diverse communities, expertise in activating different organizational capabilities, and partnerships across the financial system to drive solutions that improve 
affordability, access, and quality of life.Inclusive Growth consists of six sections:1. The Introduction demonstrates the economic and social imperative for inclusive growth, supported by key insights from Goldman Sachs’ proprietary research.2. Our History outlines leading initiatives the firm has launched to advance inclusive growth, such as 10,000 Small Businesses and 10,000 Women, and investments led by our Urban Investment Group. Within this section, One Million Black Women highlights how all of the lessons learned throughout our history of investing in underserved communities have culminated in our latest signature inclusive growth initiative, which focuses on increasing opportunity at key moments in Black women’s lives.3. Defining and Executing on Our Strategy illustrates  the ways we are leveraging the breadth of our business and commercial capabilities to help expand access, lower costs, and improve outcomes. Sustainability Report 2021Inclusive Growth  |  Executive Summary4. Leveraging Partnerships to Close Gaps examines how we partner with and provide grant funding to world-class community organizations to amplify our own impact and build long-term relationships with communities.5. Driving Change Across Our Firm focuses on how we promote diversity and inclusivity within Goldman Sachs and highlights programs launched by and for our own people.6. What to Expect Next gives a sense of the work to come, including the ways in which we continue to take a holistic, interconnected approach to our work on climate transition and inclusive growth. IntroductionThe Economic Imperative for Inclusive GrowthInclusive growth is critical to a healthier, more vibrant economy for all and is a powerful performance driver for companies and investors.Growth That Is Not Inclusive Is Not SustainableOur Womenomics research demonstrates  the economic case for increasing opportunities for women. • The Womenomics 5.0 report estimates that closing the gender employment gap could lift Japan’s GDP by 15%. • The Investing in EM Womenomics report found that investing in emerging markets with higher gender equality would have yielded outperformance over time. • The Black Womenomics report estimates that reducing the earnings gap for Black women could create 1.2 million to 1.7 million US jobs and raise the annual US GDP by 1.4% to 2.1% each year — which translates to $300 to $450 billion in current dollars. 1—Worldbank: “2021 Year in Review in 11 Charts: The Inequality Pandemic,” December 2021.2—Global Entrepreneurship Monitor: “COVID-19 Impacts on Women Entrepreneurs in Emerging Economies: Insights and Indicators,” February 2022.3—Frontiers in Public Health: “Socioeconomic Status and Access to Healthcare: Interrelated Drivers for Healthy Aging,” June 2020.4—McKinsey & Company: “Diversity wins: How inclusion matters,”May 2020.5—Crunchbase: “Black Women Still Receive Just A Tiny FractionSustainability Report 2021	 Of VC Funding Despite 5-Year HigInclusive Grh,” July 2021.owth  |  IntroductionWe believe that there is an economic and social imperative to close access gaps in emerging markets and low socioeconomic communities. Making these changes is essential to driving longterm inclusive, sustainable outcomes.• While people across all income groups experienced losses during the pandemic, the poorest 20% of the world experienced the steepest decline in incomes1.• Low-income countries show the highest rates of women’s business startup but lower levels of investment2.• In a variety of contexts, lower socioeconomic status is associated with more access barriers to healthcare, which is subsequently associated with worse health outcomes3.• For companies in the top quartile for ethnic and cultural diversity, there is a 36% higher likelihood of industry-leading profitability — and top-quartile companies in gender diversity have a 25% higher likelihood of outperforming on profitability when compared to less diverse companies4.  Yet, women-only founded companies received only 2% of US VC investment, and Black entrepreneurs received just 1.2% in the first half  of 20215.
How We’re RespondingWe are leveraging the lessons from our history of leadership, our work with clients at the core of our business, our own organization and supply chain, and our external partnerships and philanthropy to advance inclusive growth. We believe that the private sector has tremendous power to drive change and contribute to a more diverse and inclusive economy. By working with our clients, our partners, and our people, and by helping our clients and investors build their capacities to drive impact on inclusive growth, we believe we can make a meaningful and enduring impact. But we also recognize that this work is a journey. As we look to make progress on our commitment to advance inclusive growth, we recognize that we must continue to listen to, learn from, and navigate the evolving sensitivities for the different communities in which we serve.
Our History of Leadership in Inclusive GrowthOur 20-year history of investing in underserved communities serves as the foundation of our work to advance inclusive growth.Urban Investment Group (UIG)Leveraging capital and community connection to drive outcomes  We established our Urban Investment Group (UIG) in 2001, grounded in the belief that capital markets can and should play an important role in creating opportunities for underserved people and places. Since its inception, UIG has invested more than $12 billion in innovative capital solutions that strengthen communities and promote long-term economic growth. Partnering with local public- and private-sector leaders, UIG makes investments to strengthen the fundamental building blocks of opportunity — including affordable housing, commercial and community facility space in underserved areas, quality education and healthcare, and growth capital for social enterprises and small businesses. 
Launch With GSActing on data to expand business opportunities  We believe the evidence that diversity is good for business is clear, yet only a small percentage of US venture capital goes to diverse teams. Our $1 billion investment strategy, Launch With GS, aims to increase access to capital and facilitate connections for women, Black, Latinx, and other diverse entrepreneurs and investors.Board Diversity Commitment Driving action through our firm  In 2020, we committed to ensuring every company we take public in the US or Western Europe includes at least one diverse board member. Last year, we increased the requirement to two diverse board members, specifying that one must be a woman. We have also helped facilitate more than 50 diverse board placements across our clients. Additionally, we have welcomed a third cohort of our Spotlight initiative, which provides a platform as well as exposure and networking opportunities to a select group of talented, diverse board candidates who have not yet served on public boards — providing them with ease of entry to corporate board service.We are also focused on board diversity within Asset Management, where we have influence on the companies in our portfolios.  On the public side, our Global Stewardship team promotes greater levels of board diversity through selected proxy voting rules we have established. On the private side, we have improved board diversity across all of our companies we invest in and achieved our 2020 goal to have a diverse director on 100% of controlled portfolio company boards (those where Asset Management owns 50% or greater of the company). In 2021, we made substantial progress on the private side through our requirements that any portfolio company that goes public and any new controlled portfolio company must have two diverse board members, and that a substantial majority of non-controlled portfolio companies have board-level diversity.10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses Matching the power of capital with philanthropy to maximize impact  In 2008, Goldman Sachs launched 10,000 Women — a global initiative that provides thousands of underserved women entrepreneurs around the world with business and management education. To date, 10,000 Women has supported more than 150,000 women from around the world through a network of 100 academic and nonprofit partners and coaching with Goldman Sachs employees.In 2014, in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), 10,000 Women launched the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility (WEOF), a first-of-its-kind global facility dedicated exclusively to expanding access to finance for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) managed by women in developing countries. To date, we have reached over 144,000 women entrepreneurs across 42 markets and have mobilized $2.1 billion.Building on the success of 10,000 Women, in 2010, Goldman Sachs launched 10,000 Small Businesses, a program designed to provide entrepreneurs with business education, access capital, and support services. To date, over 12,350 small businesses have graduated from the education program, and over 37,000 have accessed over $1.6 billion in lending capital through our investments in Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs).10,000 Small Businesses expanded to the United Kingdom in 2010 and to France in 2020, serving over 2,000 entrepreneurs across both countries to date.



Driving Impact Through Investments and 	INCLUSIVE GROWTH Philanthropic PartnershipsWe believe that a combination of commercial and philanthropic capital can be harnessed to create meaningful, lasting impact.In the past year, we’ve focused on a variety of investments, partnerships, and grants that align with important moments in Black women’s lives. Many of our focus areas for these investments and initiatives were identified through our 
listening sessions.Over $870 million of investment capital and more than $9 million in philanthropic capital has been invested alongside Black women to date, laying the groundwork to directly impact the lives over 107,000 Black women across  the country. “This significant partnership with Goldman Sachs’ One Million Black Women will meaningfully address funding gaps faced by emerging Black women entrepreneurs. By engaging with and directly lending to communities of color, we are making financial inclusion a reality for tens of thousands of Black women now and far into the future.”ALETHIA MENDEZ Division President for Elevating Black Women Sustainability Report 2021Entrepreneurs, Grameen AmericaInclusive Growth  |  One Million Black WomenGrowing a BusinessGrameen America  For the first time, Goldman Sachs has provided capital for microloans through a new partnership with Grameen. Our $20 million loan will help finance small business loans to lowincome Black women entrepreneurs as part of Grameen’s new “Elevating Black Women Entrepreneurs” initiative “Elevate.” Launched in May 2021, “Elevate” is a dedicated program that will offer loan capital, technical assistance, and financial coaching to Black women small business owners. Grameen will partner with local organizations on outreach and recruitment, as well as tailor and strengthen its business and financial education programming to better meet the needs of Black women entrepreneurs.Collab Capital We invested in Collab Capital, an early-stage venture capital fund investing in Black founders. Collab Capital seeks to address the lack of capital access for Black entrepreneurs; currently, approximately 1% of venture capital goes to Black-founded companies while Black Americans represent 14% of the US population. Collab Capital also looks to optimize financial and social capital to help Black founders build profitable and sustainable businesses, investing in tech and tech-enabled companies working on innovative solutions in niche or growth markets.

Building on our long history as a firm and the commercial insights we have gained over the years, we continue to infuse lessons into our own consumer business — where the power of technology, data, and our own leadership and commitment to consumers converge to help democratize consumer finance at scale.In the consumer business, our vision is to build the consumer banking platform of the future to meet the saving, spending, borrowing, and investing needs of our customers. We believe in playing an impactful role in shaping consumers’ wealth, so our products are designed to help power consumers’ financial ambitions and their pursuit of better financial outcomes. We are uniquely positioned to serve our customers by marrying two distinct Goldman Sachs capabilities: our 150+ years of financial expertise and excellence and an interconnected, tech-fueled consumer banking platform.Customers experience our consumer business in two ways: through our direct-to-consumer business Marcus and in the ecosystems of our partners. We use our technology and our expertise to embed powerful financial tools into consumers’ daily lives — meeting them where they are, anticipating their needs, removing friction, and providing insights into their finances.In everything we do, we put customers at the center through a variety of financial products that meet their needs: a high-yield online savings account; certificates of deposit in a variety of terms; no-fee, fixed-rate, unsecured personal loans; financing for small businesses; managed portfolios of of exchange-traded funds (ETFs); and free financial literacy tools all integrated into a digital app experience. Apple Card, launched in 2019 in partnership with Apple, aims to revolutionize the credit card experience and help consumers lead a healthier financial life with features that include: no fees1, Daily Cash back, and seamless integration into Apple’s mobile devices. Customers also have access to inventive features, such as Apple Card Family, which allows individuals to build credit together as equals2. In January, we launched our second co-branded credit card, GM Card, in partnership with General Motors, furthering our commitment to creating great products within the ecosystems where our consumers spend their time.Being a part of our customers’ financial journey means being there every step of the way — including when customers need us most. With the onset of COVID-19, we were one of the first banks3 to design and launch a customer assistance program that allowed customers to defer payments at no cost across our lending products and Apple Card. By intertwining an understanding of our customers’ needs with social responsibility and simplicity of design, we worked with Apple to create a practical and useful solution that emphasized empathy and our commitment to customers. Additionally, as a result of our continued focus on customer centricity with Apple Card, this past year, customers recognized Goldman Sachs and Apple Card with the number one ranking in Customer Satisfaction in the Midsize Credit Card Issuers Segment according to J.D. Power — highest in the Midsize Credit Card segment among all of the surveyed factors4.Looking ahead, we’re excited to connect with our customers’ everyday money with our Marcus Checking product, which launches later this year. We know that the small decisions consumers make every day have an enormous impact on wealth, which is why we have designed Marcus Checking to focus on growth, rather than fees.We’re just getting started, and we will work to keep up with our customers’ and partners’ ambitions through listening, learning, and co-creating to drive the future of financial services.1—Variable APRs range from 11.24% to 22.24% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of April 1, 2022. 2—Apple Card will be reported to credit bureaus for each co-owner. Co-owners will have full visibility into all account activity and each co-owner is responsible for the other co-owner’s instructions or requests. Each co-owner is individually liable for all balances as they have joint responsibility for all aspects of the account, including all transactions and payment obligations on the co-owned Apple Card, and each will be reported to credit bureaus as an owner on the account. Credit reporting includes payment history and other information about your Apple Card, including negative items like missed payments. Card usage and payment history may impact each co-owners credit score differently because each individual’s credit history will include information that is unique to them. Either co-owner can close the account at any time but you will still be responsible for paying all balances on the account.

Our investment will contribute to Propel’s mission to remove systemic barriers to financial services for marginalized populations. With a focus on supporting individuals that qualify for Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards that accompany the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Propel’s platform enables users to manage their EBT benefits, plan their shopping trips, save money on groceries, and connect to other essential resources. Wonderschool and the Care Economy Goldman Sachs has invested in Wonderschool, a Black-led child care technology company that offers cutting-edge software solutions that help deliver value across the child care landscape, from providers, employers, and parents to government and nonprofits. With its robust software platform, Wonderschool seeks to help expand access to those who need it most by enabling critical homebased child care in areas with limited or no availability — particularly in chronically underserved communities of color and among low-income families. “What’s so beautiful about Wonderschool is we truly do serve the entire community. Parents, program directors, and children are all part of the work we do, and they’re the reason we fight so hard for education. … We’re working so hard to ensure equal opportunities for children, and it’s so exciting to see access expand for all types of communities.” CHRIS BENNETTCo-founder and CEO, Wonderschool
1TechnologyMercado Libre Brazil As host to the largest online commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America, Mercado Libre has a mission to provide tools that contribute to the development of the region’s growing e-commerce community while also fostering entrepreneurship and social mobility. They also provide access to a digital account through Mercado Pago, which allows users to access a centralized money management system to receive, transfer, save, and access credit in one place. We increased Mercado Libre’s credit line to help them support those in the region who have traditionally faced a barrier to credit access.Reach Capital Reach Capital, an Imprint-funded manager, invests in early- to growth-stage impactful education technology companies focused on B2B, B2C, and marketplace solutions. Comprised of former teachers and operators, the Reach team is diverse in both identity and experience, having recently topped the Information’s VC Diversity Index. Reach Capital targets investments across the early childhood, K–12, higher education, workforce development, and human empowerment sectors that may lead to strong financial outcomes in addition to tangible impact across educational access, affordability, quality, and outcomes. This includes investments in Springboard, which provides advanced online courses for students to learn data, design, and coding skills with wraparound support from mentors and community, as well as BookNook, an online learning platform that provides reading and math support through engaging and collaborative technology.Business Model InnovationsInnovative and forward-thinking business models can unlock opportunities and access to services by creating new revenue streams and reducing cost barriers compared to traditional models.EVERFI Using cutting-edge technology and building the infrastructure to provide impact-as-a-service within communities, EVERFI is connecting learning to the real world by delivering researchbacked education to more than seven million learners annually and more than 2,000 global customers, making learning scalable and impact measurable. EVERFI’s innovative business model provides free access for students and employees to evidence-based educational curricula, offering high-impact classes for underserved communities that may otherwise face cost barriers. Goldman Sachs acted as an exclusive financial advisor to EVERFI, including on their recent acquisition by social impact computer software organization Blackbaud. 303 Battery by Sustainable Living Innovations (SLI) Goldman Sachs provided a loan for the construction of SLI’s 303 Battery, a 15-story, 112-unit, mixed-use, mixedincome building located in Belltown, one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in Seattle. The technology and design incorporated into 303 Battery’s construction are aimed at producing a high level of energy efficiency.  This loan is designed to create new affordable housing by using patented prefabricated, panelized material and technology to reduce construction costs, increase environmental efficiency, and promote safer construction conditions. Moreover, 303 Battery will be a Zero Net Energy residential tower. The project will achieve net climate positive energy by providing at least 105% of all energy consumed via a combination of on-site and off-site clean energy production, allowing additional density and operational cost savings.2Business Model InnovationsNextStep NextStep, a portfolio company of an Imprint-funded manager, is a healthcare innovation company that is addressing the dramatic shortage of frontline caregivers, focusing on nursing assistants. NextStep is creating opportunities for low-wage workers and those whose jobs have been displaced by AI or automation to receive technology-enabled training, along with individualized job placement and mentorship services, enabling workers to start a productive career while addressing the biggest business challenge facing long term care providers. Brigit Brigit, a portfolio company of an Imprint-funded manager, is a leading holistic financial health application for millions of underserved Americans that provides its members with budgeting tools, access to early paycheck advances, a credit building and savings product, and opportunities to earn additional income. The company’s business model doesn’t rely on the continuous use of its advances or borrowing in ever larger amounts — instead, Brigit benefits when its members are better able to manage their earnings and expenses and use advances with less frequency. Through its cash flow based engine, which analyzes billions of transactions in real time, Brigit is able to underwrite users without relying on traditional credit scores, while remaining focused on low loss rates. This innovative, machine learning platform also provides personalized financial recommendations and insights to help them improve their finances. Since its launch only three years ago, Brigit has distributed $1 billion in advances, helping more than 3 million users reduce their financial stress, and saving them over $360 million in predatory fees.Cityblock Health To support a shift toward more inclusive healthcare systems, Imprint participated in the $160 million Series C funding round of Cityblock Health. The healthcare provider’s community- and value-based care model aims to bring necessary transformation to Medicaid and lower-income Medicare beneficiaries, some of the most vulnerable and underserved populations in the country. The organization provides members with primary care, behavioral health services, and services to address the social determinants of health, both virtually and in person. 3Supporting the Public SectorIn complex areas where the risks or costs for private capital are high, the public sector can help to close the gap.Smart Luz In 2021, Brazilian subconcessionare Smart Luz issued approximately $163 million in BRL-denominated 144a/ RegS bonds to finance a street lighting public-private partnership project in Rio de Janeiro. Goldman Sachs acted as sole global coordinator, bookrunner, and sustainability bond structuring agent. Beginning with street lighting, the project will modernize Rio de Janeiro through a “smart city” approach that includes cameras, Wi-Fi points, traffic controllers, and manhole sensors. Rumichaca-Pasto  Goldman Sachs was joint global coordinator, bookrunner, and lead arranger on the $798 million-equivalent project financing for Rumichaca-Pasto, a toll road connecting the border crossing point between Colombia and Ecuador, with the city of Pasto, Colombia. Estimated to serve 7 million people, Rumichaca-Pasto will expand a major commercial route to help rural farmers reach larger markets and stimulate the local economy, in addition to generating traveltime savings. The transaction represents the largest social bond tied to an infrastructure project in Latin America.California Statewide Communities Development Authority (CSCDA) Workforce Housing In 2021, Goldman Sachs Investment Banking raised more than $2.7 billion through 12 separate transactions for a CSCDA Community Improvement Authority (CSCDA CIA) public-private partnership program that utilizes governmental ownership and private sector asset management to create and sustain high-quality, affordable housing for middle-income earners (also known as essential or workforce housing). This transaction series included the first social bond issuance in the essential housing sector, and each of the 12 transactions were ultimately designated social bonds pursuant to a social bond framework, which the Goldman Sachs team crafted with the issuer.Republic of Chile In July 2021, Goldman Sachs led a $5.8 billion multitranche and multi-currency social bond offering for the Republic of Chile in support of the government’s COVID-19 relief package. The bond offering represented the fourth consecutive transaction Goldman Sachs led for the Republic of Chile in 2021 (amounting to more than $9 billion in proceeds) — and further cemented Chile as the most active sovereign issuer of ESG bonds in Latin America. Chile intends to invest proceeds from the social bonds into projects that may qualify as eligible social expenditures under Chile’s Sustainable Bond Framework. 4Power of DataData can help to provide critical information to not only identify financing and knowledge gaps in need of further investment but also to empower companies and their customers to make informed decisions and act on new insights.Esusu Esusu, a leading financial technology company, reports on-time rental payments data to credit bureaus on behalf of landlords, with the aim of helping renters access a meaningful credit-building opportunity. Our partnership began in 2019, when we funded a pilot rent-reporting program implemented by Esusu and the Credit Builders Alliance demonstrating how rent reporting can improve credit scores. In 2021, we expanded our partnership, extending Esusu’s rent-reporting data opportunity to thousands of residents in Goldman Sachs properties nationwide.“Credit is the building block of financial stability, opportunity, and resiliency in this country. Esusu and Goldman Sachs are working together to help renters access the same credit-building benefits that homeowners have utilized for generations. This partnership, our first with a major financial institution, is groundbreaking for us because we can scale across the Goldman Sachs real estate investment portfolio and its extensive housing footprint while advocating for our shared commitment to removing systemic housing inequalities that negatively impact the financial wellbeing of under-resourced communities.”ABBEY WEMIMO AND SAMIR GOELCo-founders, EsusuNova Credit Nova Credit, a portfolio company of a firm with whom clients of Imprint have invested, is a borderless credit bureau that helps newcomers to the US apply for financial services using their international credit histories from countries that include Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico, Nigeria, South Korea, and the UK. Historically, American underwriters have been unable to access international credit data, thus rendering newcomers to the US “credit invisible” upon arrival, which often prevents them from accomplishing basic tasks, such as securing an apartment lease, cell phone plan, credit card, or student loan. JUST Muni Racial Equity Framework In an effort to evaluate more municipalities for racial equity practices, Goldman Sachs joined JUST Capital to develop a municipal racial equity engagement framework. Goldman Sachs and JUST Capital, along with BlackRock, Lord Abbett, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, and Vanguard, worked together to initiate an open, constructive, and voluntary dialogue with municipal issuers on critical issues surrounding racial equity and inclusion. The framework’s long-term goal is to build a broad partnership that includes municipal issuers, asset managers, and underwriters and improves transparency in a segment of the market where disclosure has been historically limited.Leveraging Machine Learning to Determine  Long-term Growth  We believe that companies that can effectively attract, deploy, and retain high-quality employees are better positioned for long-term growth. Our Quantitative Equity business deploys Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights from the written portions of employee reviews on Glassdoor, in addition to analyzing the numerical ratings. Our NLP algorithms treat each word, or set of words, in a review as a unique variable and then seek to identify which variables are best distinguished between positive and negative reviews. This approach enables us to use employee satisfaction data to determine the long-term growth potential of a business. 
Driving DiversityWe identify opportunities with our clients, partners, and companies in which we invest to prioritize diversity among teams, brokers, and boards.Board Diversity Initiative In 2020, we announced that we would take a company public in the US or Western Europe only if it had at least one diverse board member, founded on the belief that diverse leadership at companies leads to stronger performance and better governance. Building on that commitment, we increased this requirement last year to two diverse board members, one of whom must be a woman. We have helped facilitate more than 50 diverse board placements across our clients.As part of this initiative, we continue to elevate diverse talent through our networks in the firm, including individuals with relationships across Investment Banking, Private Wealth Management, and Ayco as potential candidates, in addition to external networks.Goldman Sachs Asset Management Stewardship  Our Global Stewardship Team seeks to promote best practices in ESG and corporate governance at portfolio companies through proxy voting, direct engagement, and industry collaboration.For more information on how Goldman Sachs Asset Management engages with hundreds of companies around the world, please review our Stewardship Report.Promoting Board Diversity 5Commitment and LeadershipWithin our firm and across our broader ecosystem of partners, we have a range of tools designed to advance inclusive growth. However, mobilizing these resources begins with leadership and commitment, which allow us to drive progress in key areas with an aim toward long-term impact.We use our voice as shareholders through proxy voting — encouraging greater levels of board diversity at our portfolio companies. Since 2019, we voted against directors at all-male boards in the US, and we are pleased to see that 68% of the 250 companies we voted against in 2019 have since added at least one woman director?. In 2020, we made our approach global and voted against 898 companies for not having at least one woman director. Twenty-seven percent of these companies now have at least one woman director?.In 2021, we updated our US proxy voting policy to consider the composition of boards across race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, as well as gender, while globally we continued to push for gender representation. We voted against directors at 1,172 companies in 2021 due to lack of board diversity.Trader Interactive In 2017, Goldman Sachs Private Equity group saw an opportunity to support Virginia-based Trader Interactive in its mission to digitalize the search and purchase of non-automobile motor vehicles through its online marketplaces. At this time, Trader Interactive — led by CEO Lori Stacy — was already a diverse company, with 43% of leadership positions held by women (compared to the average 11% in senior leadership roles within technology and media3). Aligned on the importance of diversity in ideas and perspectives, Goldman Sachs has, over the years, advised on recruiting candidates with diverse backgrounds at the executive level, while Trader Interactive prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion to differentiate their company as the employer of choice and as an innovator in the traditionally male-dominated vehicle and technology sector. By creating an inclusive workplace with 83% diversity at the executive level, Trader Interactive benefits from an engaged employee base — resulting in more stimulating discussions, increased innovation, and less turnover.1, 2—Figures as of December 31, 2021. 3—McKinsey & Company: “Closing the tech gender gap through philanthropy and corporate social responsibility.” September 2018.Unlocking More Impact from CapitalThrough analysis, expertise, and curated sustainable finance solutions, we can deliver even more value for our clients to achieve better outcomes both today and tomorrow. This practical ingenuity ensures we maximize results from capital.Loop Capital  To help promote racial equity and build diverse talent, Loop Capital, a Black woman-owned financial services firm, and Goldman Sachs partnered to launch two money market products and offer clients a cash management solution aligned with the goals of One Million Black Women. Google made a $500 million catalytic seed investment and played a foundational role in developing the products. Ten percent of net revenues earned from share classes go toward funding for programs focused on two priorities of One Million Black Women — housing and education — and Goldman Sachs shares a portion of its management fee with Loop Capital for distributing the share class to clients.Marquee for e-Quality  Goldman Sachs recently announced the continuation of the Marquee for e-Quality initiative for the second consecutive year. Building on the previous year’s success, we continue to leverage commercial initiatives to scale our impact on inclusive growth.“This launch creates a partnership for corporations to use the cash on their balance sheets to further opportunities for Black women and have a real, lasting impact on communities far and wide.”KOURTNEY GIBSONPresident, Loop Capital MarketsThrough the initiative, Goldman Sachs committed to a donation based on FX and Commodities volumes traded on Marquee Trader, as well as FX volumes traded via Passive Currency Overlay, which will go to nonprofit grantees of the Goldman Sachs Fund for Racial Equity.Last year’s inaugural campaign saw $1.1 million raised from more than 56 different countries, supporting the vital work of leading organizations addressing racial injustice, structural inequity, and economic disparity globally.Choosing Who We Work WithDiverse Broker Dealers We actively engage with corporate clients on best practices around diversity, equity, and inclusion, most recently providing a comprehensive scorecard to assist with assessing capabilities and authenticity of minority-owned broker dealers. To set an example, our $800 million debut sustainability bond in February 2021 had a syndicate of exclusively minority-led broker dealers.Supporting Diverse Leadership in the Broader EcosystemNonprofit Diversity Fund (NDF) The NDF seeks to foster opportunities for commercial and community impact by preparing diverse advisors to become nonprofit leaders through education, cultivation, and integration into the nonprofit community. Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management has committed $500,000 to cover board membership dues for diverse advisors to join nonprofit boards in their communities, thus decreasing the largest barrier to entry to board membership.Empowering WorkersWe believe that engaged employees will be a driving force in building a more inclusive financial future. Sterling Employee Ownership  Goldman Sachs is partnering with background check firm Sterling as it shares the benefits of company success to drive financial inclusion and build a stronger partnership across the employee base. Goldman Sachs Asset Management has been a controlling shareholder in Sterling for nearly seven years, working with the company’s management team to build Sterling into one of the largest providers of pre-employment background screening and identity services globally. Goldman Sachs acted as lead bookrunning manager for the company’s IPO offering in September 2021, where Sterling granted stock awards to each of its 5,513 employees globally.The companywide stock grant represents a continuing commitment by the company and Goldman Sachs Asset Management as a controlling shareholder to expand access to wealth and ensure every Sterling employee has compensation that grows alongside the company. For most employees granted the IPO stock award, it was their first opportunity to share in company equity.Goldman Sachs Asset Management Joins Ownership Works Consortium In efforts to further our shared ownership program, Goldman Sachs joined a newly-formed coalition led by Ownership Works, a nonprofit focused on partnering with companies and investors to provide employees with the opportunity to build wealth at work. As a founding partner, Goldman Sachs is committing to implement new models of employee ownership within at least three controlled portfolio companies by 2023.Sustainability Report 2021Ayco Financial Wellness Goldman Sachs’ Ayco Personal Financial Management’s Wellness Platform is an industry-pioneering digital platform designed to enable a more productive, financially well, and engaged workforce. In partnering with Ayco, organizations can provide their employees with key resourcing, including financial coaching, helpful reports and viewpoints, and tailormade programs for every career stage.• SurvivorSupport® Ayco’s SurvivorSupport® provides specialized financial guidance in times of personal crisis and loss, supporting individuals and families through challenging financial decisions. It offers services to more than 130 corporate clients, covering more than 3.2 million employees in the US. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we extended our services to hospital systems on a feewaived basis. • Diversity and Inclusion Ayco is partnering with our corporate clients’ global diversity and inclusion networks and HR teams to provide diverse communities with group education sessions. Ayco also works with corporate teams to advance their diversity and inclusion initiatives. We partnered with IBM to support its P-TECH hiring programs. P-TECH is a public-education model that provides high school students from underserved backgrounds with the academic, technical, and professional skills and credentials they need for competitive STEM jobs. SurvivorSupport® is a registered trademark of the Ayco Company, L.P. and is provided exclusively by the Ayco Company, L.P.

Our business operations, in turn, provide business opportunities for others. Since 2000, our Vendor Diversity Program has worked to foster a sustainable, diverse supply chain by increasing market access for small businesses and minority-owned businesses.
Goldman Sachs Gives Goldman Sachs Gives fosters innovative ideas, works to solve economic and social issues, and enables progress in underserved communities globally. Goldman Sachs’ current and retired senior employees work together to recommend grants to qualifying nonprofit organizations to help them achieve their goals.Since 2010, Goldman Sachs Gives has granted more than $2 billion to over 8,000 nonprofits in 100 countries around the world. In 2021, Goldman Sachs Gives deployed over $230 million in grants to support pioneering nonprofit organizations and firm initiatives. Analyst Impact Fund The Analyst Impact Fund has generated more than $2.7 million in grants to 93 nonprofits to date.

This nonprofit attracts, prepares, and connects people with disabilities to scholarships, internships, and full-time opportunities with leading corporations.To scale Lime Connect’s impact and mission, the team will develop a digital platform that integrates the organization’s existing resources into an accessible, modern framework that supports community building and outcome tracking. Lime Connect has worked with Goldman Sachs for nearly 15 years on disability inclusion.COVID-19 Relief Fund The Goldman Sachs COVID-19 Relief Fund was created to help the world’s hardest-hit communities during the pandemic. This fund has deployed $54 million to more than 300 nonprofits across 31 countries. Last year, this included $10 million to support COVID-19 relief and recovery efforts in India, prioritizing frontline health facilities in key cities, such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and New Delhi, with help that include vaccination, mental health, and economic recovery efforts. Relief Efforts for UkraineGoldman Sachs has been focused on how to effectively help communities impacted by the conflict in Ukraine. Goldman Sachs and its employees have deployed over $3 million in donations to support nonprofit organizations providing Ukrainian families with emergency assistance, such as food, medical care, and essential goods, as people have fled their homes. 
Employee Engagement Community TeamWorks (CTW) Marking its 25th anniversary in 2021, Goldman Sachs Community TeamWorks (CTW) facilitates relationships between our employees and nonprofits to meaningfully serve people around the world. Our firm’s tradition involves a long-standing culture of service. In 2021, we showed that when called to action, our business and our people often exceeded expectations and helped to drive impact.25 YEARS OF CTW>470,000Volunteers>3,000 Nonprofits2,800,000 Hours of serviceIn 2021, we doubled down on our virtual volunteering strategy amid the pandemic, and volunteers were able to collectively contribute 29,000 hours to support groups disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and to help advance racial equity.Together, more than 2,000 employees saved 279,700 kg of carbon dioxide via the Count Us In Climate Challenge. In 2021, we redoubled our virtual volunteering strategy so we could continue safely serving our communities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual volunteers worked on projects promoting racial equity and supporting groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. In total, CTW volunteers completed more than 215 virtual projects supporting 170 nonprofits globally.Where it was safe to do so, our volunteers showed up in person in the fall of 2021 to build affordable housing, revitalize neighborhoods, and clean parks and green spaces — contributing to 200 projects worldwide.The CTW program in our EMEA offices also launched Count Us In, a three-month challenge to employees to reduce their carbon footprints. Together, more than 2,000 employees saved 279,700 kg of carbon dioxide.
Our PeopleWe recognize that the strength of our people drives our success. Our first-ever People Strategy Report, published in 2020, outlines the three pillars to our talentcentric organization: attracting talent; supporting our people and sustaining our culture; and broadening our impact. It demonstrated how we support the firm’s strategic objectives and act as an accelerator to meeting our Investor Day Goals.Upcoming 2021  People Strategy ReportIt was a challenging year for everyone — our clients, our people, and our communities. But even in an incredibly dynamic market environment, our people came together, we stayed true to our strategy, and we put our clients first. Our people have always been our most important asset, and it is because of them that we delivered exceptional results to our shareholders.Achieving sustainable, inclusive growth for the world’s leading businesses, entrepreneurs, and institutions requires world-class talent thinking collaboratively while navigating complex challenges. The strategy we use to engage with our people is an extension of our overall business strategy and is fundamental to driving success at every level and across every business. We accomplish this by continuing to evolve our people practices with excellence — delivering talent initiatives rooted in our purpose of advancing climate transition and driving inclusive growth; supporting our people’s development; and building the future together.We plan to share further details in our second People Strategy Report, which we will publish in May 2022.
Vendor Diversity Program Spotlight2021 was another year of significant progress in our efforts to support more small and diverse businesses. Our efforts were underpinned by robust engagement programs and enhanced vendor diversity data tracking and reporting throughout our sourcing and payment systems. We established a firmwide Vendor Diversity Steering Group to drive increased awareness and accountability for our goals, and in partnership with our One Million Black Women initiative, we convened an internal group of ambassadors to focus on identifying more Black women-owned enterprises for our supply chain.GOODS AND SERVICES PURCHASED FROM SMALL AND DIVERSE VENDORS GLOBALLY>$265M  >$335MIn 2020	In 20212021 SPEND WITH SMALL & DIVERSE VENDORS6%	68%Of addressable spend 	Went to minority- went to small and 	or women-owned diverse vendors	businesses32%	30%Went to small 	Was Tier 2 spend businessesWorking closely with our teams, we set internal targets across the firm’s key spend categories and included, where possible, small and diverse businesses within our Request for Proposals (RFPs) for vendors. Tier 2 subcontracting opportunities for small and diverse businesses were pursued with our prime vendors.We continued to partner with certifying agencies in different regions, joining MSDUK, taking a seat on WEConnect International’s board, supporting Disability: IN’s mentoring program, and, in partnership with our 10,000 Small Businesses program, providing training to small and diverse businesses on protecting intellectual property.As a result of our efforts, in 2021 we spent over $335 million globally with small and diverse businesses, bringing us more than halfway to our 2025 goal of increasing our spend by 50% from our 2020 baseline. Our addressable spend with small and diverse businesses increased from 5% to 6%.
Vendor Diversity Program: Global HighlightsNorth America: 200 West In 2021, when Goldman Sachs relocated our executive office within the building, small and diverse businesses received more than 40% of overall construction payments and nearly 100% of the furniture orders.Ronda Jackson, a certified Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises (MWBE) interior designer, incorporated design items from 10,000 Small Businesses alumni. The pieces were displayed in the firmwide amenity space.As part of our One Million Black Women launch campaign, our marketing team prioritized partnerships with women-owned businesses, including creative agency Hive, Poochie Collins for visual design and photography, and Essence, Blavity, and Ebony as media partners.APAC: Diversifying Campus Support in India At our Bengaluru campus, we introduced a 100% womenmanaged Starbucks outlet, the first of its kind in South India, and our employee commute program hired 15 women drivers. In Hyderabad, 100% of vendors hired to support ground transportation are small- or medium-enterprises or diverse businesses.EMEA: Experience in Hospitality Program BaxterStorey, our hospitality vendor in London, partnered with the Africa Centre, a London-based charity that celebrates the diversity of Africa and its people. In conjunction with ESG-focused food and beverage popups, we welcomed aspiring chefs and food entrepreneurs to our on-site restaurant over the course of October 2021.Australia: Building and Supplying Workplaces For the recent fit out of our offices in Australia, we contracted with Indigenous-owned companies to supply workstations and manage our office moves.
At The Conrad New York Downtown, we successfully engaged another female 10,000 Small Businesses graduate to repair and replace awnings.“ShadeFLA is grateful for the opportunity to have bid on a Goldman Sachs project in NYC in 202021. As a Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses  graduate, I greatly benefited from participating in the 10,000 Small Businesses program that has taught me to take my business to the next level. Through the Goldman Sachs Vendor Program open to 10,000 Small Businesses alumni, I was able to successfully bid on and win two contracts for shade structures at The Conrad New York Downtown. The timing of these awards was crucial for ShadeFLA’s sales during the pandemic. As a Hispanic-owned business, we appreciated these contracts because they kept our bottom line growing, which provided funds to keep our team employed.”“The 10,000 Small Businesses program has always been about more than just business growth; it’s about building resilient businesses that can weather any storm. This has never been more important than during the pandemic, when so many businesses have been forced to pivot or shut down entirely.The opportunity to work with Goldman Sachs’ projects team benefited my company not just financially, but it allowed me to tap into my optimism, creativity, and support other 10,000 Small Businesses alumni businesses throughout the project. This was very rewarding because community works when we support one another. The pandemic was a difficult time for everyone, but I’m grateful that the project helped me get through it. It reminded me that even in tough times, we can continue to grow, thrive, and create new relationships for future opportunities.”

What to Expect NextOur commitment to driving inclusive growth can be successful only if we prioritize longevity, and we see continuous growth and evolution ahead for our key initiatives. Through One Million Black Women, we will strive to be continuously responsive to the challenges, needs, solutions, and desires we uncovered through listening sessions, our partner organizations, and our advisory council. A listeningfirst approach remains critical as we continue to evaluate areas in which capital and investment can make the biggest difference. However, we also understand the imperative of translating our learnings into action — we continue to focus on implementation and look for opportunities to partner with our clients to deepen our impact together.Importantly, climate change has continued to disproportionately impact low-income and marginalized communities, and we must prepare for the economic and structural changes that will be required to ensure an inclusive transition. We believe thoughtful public policy, in addition to capital, will play a vital role in addressing the disproportionate impacts that these groups face. At Goldman Sachs, the imperative of an inclusive transition sits at the crux of our core sustainability priorities: climate transition and inclusive growth. By connecting our experience as a financial institution with the insights gained through our work with clients and partners and our ongoing engagement with the public sector and the broader community, we believe we can drive capital toward solutions that will help communities not only adapt but also take ownership to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. Our approach to supporting an inclusive transition will continue to evolve as we address the growing and dynamic needs of our clients, markets, and communities. INCLUSIVE TRANSITION• Climate resilience: lower-income and marginalized communities who are more prepared and protected from the impact of climate change• Workforce development and job training: accessible re-skilling to meet new market demands• Energy access for all groupsSustainability Report 2021Inclusive Growth | What to Expect NextWe expect that our work to support an inclusive transition, in partnership with our clients, the public sector, and broader stakeholders, will continue to be an important area of focus for our firm as we look forward. As we look toward the future, we also look to learn from our recent experience deploying capital and financing solutions for companies that are driving progress toward both inclusive growth and climate-related goals.
BlocPower Founded in 2012, BlocPower is a Black-led, privately held company that partners with utility companies and governments to identify, finance, and upgrade building energy systems in urban areas. Goldman Sachs provided a loan to BlocPower to finance the acquisition and installation of electric heating and cooling systems and expansion of broadband service across multifamily buildings in New York City, specifically focused on low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.In addition to more cost-efficient and energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, residents in the buildings BlocPower retrofits will benefit from improved air quality and increased temperature control. The retrofits are also expected to help BlocPower customers avoid fines related to limits on greenhouse gas emissions, including those produced by on-site fuel combustion of oil and gas boilers. Sustainability Report 2021Inclusive Growth | What to Expect NextPosiGen PosiGen, a portfolio company of a firm with whom clients of Imprint have invested in the past, is a provider of renewable energy and efficiency solutions for low- to moderate-income families. PosiGen’s solutions include solar rooftop photovoltaic (PV) and energy efficiency upgrades, such as duct sealing, CFL light bulbs, and programmable thermostats, among others. PosiGen also provides education programs for homeowners that are aimed at reducing overall energy spend. Rooftop solar and other sustainable technologies have had lower relative rates of penetration for these families, given high up-front costs and perceived financing risks for a lower-income population. PosiGen employs proprietary methods to underwrite creditworthiness instead of adhering to a FICO score cutoff, which may help the company provide its products to more households than would receive them under traditional credit writing.Los Angeles Clippers Goldman Sachs led the financing for the Los Angeles Clippers’ arena, the Intuit Dome. The project will fund social and environmental programs in the City of Inglewood, including a $100 million Community Benefits Package as part of the Arena Development Agreement. The project will provide funds for affordable housing, first-time renters’ assistance, emergency support, capacity building for housing-focused nonprofits. Additional funds will go toward the installation of 1,000 electric charging units in the city, and the arena is being built to be fully electrified and operates a zero-waste program using composting and recycling technologies.

Governance at Our FirmAt Goldman Sachs, the way we do business is informed by our purpose: to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. This purpose applies to our entire firm — from our work with clients and partners to how we manage environmental and social risk. 
We seek to responsibly manage our business and fulfill our commitments to do what is best for the firm, our people, and the global community. This work is supported by strong governance structures, from our board of directors at the highest level and throughout our management structure. By integrating risk oversight into our centralized governance structures, we’re able to manage a broad spectrum of financial and nonfinancial risks across our businesses. Throughout all levels of the firm, we recognize that responsibly managing our business is paramount, and that our people are critical to that effort. We focus on providing our people with the tools and resources they need to effectively identify and escalate potential risks in their day-to-day activities, which includes training with respect to environmental and social risk.Board of DirectorsOur board and its committees are responsible for overseeing the management of the firm’s most significant risks, with a strong focus on reputational risk and long-term operations. Oversight of sustainability, climate-related risks, and social risks are interdisciplinary by nature, and as such, the board carries out its oversight directly, at the full board level, as well as through its committees, including its Public Responsibilities and Risk Committees.GovernanceSenior ManagementVarious committees and groups oversee our transaction selection decisions and risk management processes. With respect to risk management, for example, we have a Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee (FRRC), with Management Committee-level representation, which is responsible for assessing reputational risks arising from transactions that have been identified as having potential heightened reputational risk pursuant to the criteria established by the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee and as determined by committee leadership. Our Physical Commodities Review Group ensures that we maintain a consistent approach to evaluating and managing environmental, health, and safety (EHS) risks associated with engaging in, investing in, or financing physical commodityrelated activities.On a larger scale, our Firmwide Climate Steering Group, which convenes key senior stakeholders, including those from the Executive Office, Risk, Controllers, Investment Banking, Asset Management, and Global Markets divisions, provides oversight for key climate-related risk and opportunity decisions, including the interim goalsetting needed to achieve our net zero by 2050 pathway commitment. This Steering Group also reviews progress and provides feedback on climate strategy, risk management, integration, and capabilities on a broad level. This includes oversight of climate-related targets and climate reporting, related commercial engagement and integration strategy, and updates on climate risk management frameworks and capabilities.Policy, Process, and Key Groups Risk management is critical to the way we run our business, and it is deeply ingrained in our culture and business practices. For environmental and social risk, we proactively and publicly manage and report the material impacts of sustainability-related risks to our firm — a business that spans an array of sectors and regions. Policy  Our policies on sustainability are informed by perspectives of our stakeholders, including investors, non-governmental organizations, and regulators — and they help us to better advise our clients in terms of how to improve environmental and social practices. Examples of our firm’s policies include our Environmental Policy Framework, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Goldman Sachs Statement on Human Rights, and the Goldman Sachs Vendor Code of Conduct. Notably, our Environmental Policy Framework (EPF) guides our overall approach to sustainability issues — including management of environmental and social risk across a broad scope of sectors and products.Process Our advisory, financing, and direct investing teams include environmental and social due diligence as integral parts of their process. Transactions that may have significant environmental or social risks, including reputational risks, are elevated for enhanced review and business selection discussion. GovernanceKey Groups Within our Executive Office, our Sustainable Finance Group (SFG) serves as the centralized group that drives climate strategy and sustainability efforts across our firm, including commercial efforts alongside the firm’s businesses — all with the goal of advancing the success of our clients and promoting sustainable, inclusive growth and accelerating the climate transition. The SFG also engages with our stakeholders to stay abreast of and assist with environmental and social risk management and related guidelines. In addition, teams within our Legal and Compliance divisions broadly examine legal, regulatory, reputational, environmental, social, and governance risks, and review potential transactions through a risk-management lens. At an operational level, in-house specialist teams within our Risk division guide environmental, health, and safety standards for our investing activities. The teams also perform EHS due diligence on proposed investment transactions, helping business teams identify and mitigate potential risk.With respect to climate risk specifically, the Risk division is responsible for the development of the firm’s climate risk program, including setting and evaluating risk appetite, assessing climate risk, and integrating that risk into business and risk management practices.
2021 Transaction Breakdown and Highlights In 2021, the Sustainable Finance Group reviewed approximately 1,800 transactions for environmental and social risks. We identified and managed EHS risks in several potential transactions and portfolio companies — and in some cases, decided to forgo participation due to the high levels of risk that could not be mitigated or that did not align with our policies or sustainability commitments.Note: “Other” includes agriculture, cryptocurrency, carbon, consumer retail, financial sponsor, palm oil, and TMT
In 2021, we declined to participate in a number of transactions due to heightened environmental and social risk. For example, we passed on an opportunity related to financing of a thermal coal mining company with no public diversification strategy. With additional due diligence, we were unable to get comfortable with the company’s stated plans and declined the opportunity. As another example, we also declined to invest in an industrial steam business where the company’s supply of steam was primarily derived from coal power with no carbon capture and storage or equivalent carbon emissions reduction technologies in place.We also strive to ensure our approach to environmental and social risk management emphasizes constructive engagement. We work with business teams and our clients to help navigate considerations around environmental and social impacts, as well as community health and safety, for transactions across the firm, and we advise on best practices. We also assist with investments in companies that offer innovative technologies; provide guidance to improve environmental practices and disclosure; and advise on sustainable sourcing, supply chain standards, and other related areas. These teams and considerations were included in our review to finance a transaction for a mining company that focused on sourcing minerals critical to the transition to a low-carbon economy. We worked with the team and the company to review commitments related to water usage, as well as demonstrated commitments to engaging and consulting with Indigenous peoples. In another example, we have continued to engage with a manufacturing company on their EHS-related program over the years, which has resulted in improvements to safety performance and contaminationrelated issues. For our firm, putting people and practices in places that allow us to take a deliberate approach to responsible risk management across our firm is a critical driver of success.Climate Risk Management We are continuing to integrate climate risk into broader business and risk management practices, and we shared an update on our progress in the recent Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report, Accelerating Transition. Our scope and definitions of climate risks include:• Transition risk emerges from climate-related policy, legal, technology, and market changes as the economy shifts toward lower carbon usage.• Physical risk is the risk to Goldman Sachs properties, collateral, or investments due to specific weather events and longer-term shifts in the climate. Physical risk has the potential to reduce the financial value of assets. Risks related to the physical impacts of climate change include acute risks and chronic risks.As included in our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report, Accelerating Transition, we have developed methodologies for both physical and transition risk, and these methodologies serve as a foundation for measurement and integration of climate risk into business and risk processes across the firm. Integrating climate risk into the firm’s overall approach to risk management continues to be a priority. The following are examples of how we are integrating climate risk:In our risk identification process, climate risks are identified and classified, and then stressed in physical and transition risk stress-testing methodologies.• Climate risks are incorporated into the firm’s internal risk taxonomy.• Physical risk is assessed across our own operational risk footprint and at all stages of our global real estate strategy — from site selection and building design through occupancy and facilities management.• We also assess physical risk for the firm’s real estate positions, including equity investments and lending positions.• As we integrate climate risk into broader risk management, we have begun incorporating climate risk into credit evaluations and underwriting processes for select transactions, including considering climate risk factors and mitigants.• As appropriate, we are integrating climate risk considerations into appropriate frameworks and policies.XXSECTION 5Divider Key Metrics hea& Indicatorsline

The G-SIB surcharge is calculated using two methodologies, the higher of which is reflected in the firm’s risk-based capital requirements. The first calculation (Method 1) is based on the Basel Committee’s methodology, which, among other factors, relies upon measures of the size, activity, and complexity of each G-SIB. The second calculation (Method 2) uses similar inputs but includes a measure of reliance on short-term wholesale funding. Further information about Method 1 can be found on the Bank for International Settlement’s website, and further information about Method 2 can be found on the Federal Reserve Board’s website.We are bound by Method 2, and our applicable G-SIB buffer is 2.5%.

 SECTION 1 Introduction
At Goldman Sachs, our firmwide approach to sustainability is driven by our purpose: to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity for our clients, our partners, and our communities. As a core focus for the past two decades, sustainability is embedded in our firm’s business strategy and fundamental to supporting long-term growth.Sustainability Report 2021Sustainability Issuance Report | IntroductionTo achieve material change, sustainability commitments must be tied to powerful economic outcomes. We’re focused on two core pillars of sustainable finance that we believe continue to be key drivers of market risk and opportunity: climate transition and inclusive growth. We have catalyzed our commitment to sustainability by setting a target of $750 billion of financing, investing, and advisory activity, grounded in our two key pillars and spanning nine impact themes by 2030. Our inaugural Sustainability Bond and Goldman Sachs Sustainability Issuance Framework, launched in early 2021, are aligned with these same themes. The Framework expands upon our firmwide commercial model of driving capital and supporting innovation that encourages progress on climate transition and inclusive growth, and it builds upon years of experience designing and issuing Green, Social, and Sustainability financial products.As an advisor, financier, and investor, we leverage the full range of our expertise and services as we look to develop innovative sustainability solutions. From supporting sustainable infrastructure projects to investing in companies powering critical innovation in clean energy and transport, we continue to remain focused on our ability to drive capital. With a keen eye toward achieving long-term, sustainable impact, we seek to ensure a thriving future for our clients, our firm, and our communities.


Our framework for selecting projects and executing investment decisions is rigorous and multilayered in nature, reflecting the scale and importance of executing on our sustainable finance commitment.Governance As a baseline, all projects and assets under consideration for financing must meet the standards set by our existing environmental and social risk management procedures, including the Goldman Sachs Environmental Policy Framework, which provides guidance on financing in certain environmentally and socially sensitive sectors. The firm's broader risk management covers broader risk factors such as potential legal, regulatory, and governance risks.The Sustainable Asset Working Group consists of crossdivisional stakeholders from the Sustainable Finance Group, Investor Relations, Corporate Treasury, Legal, Controllers, Proceeds from Goldman Sachs’ Green, Social, or Sustainability issuances will be prioritized to finance new projects or assets that meet the criteria of the respective type of issuance and will aim to allocate all proceeds within two years following the issuance. Additionally, loans and investments that qualify under the relevant criteria made up to one year prior to the issuance are also eligible for refinancing with its proceeds.For further information on eligibility and exclusion criteria for our Green, Social, and Sustainability Issuances, please refer to our Framework.Compliance, and relevant business teams. The group reviews and confirms eligible projects and assets for funding with proceeds from Green, Social, or Sustainability issuance.Sustainability Report 2021Sustainability Issuance Report | Sustainability Issuance Framework

ReportingFor our sustainability-related commitments, we are committed to measuring and providing transparency on our progress. Annual updates regarding the allocation of the proceeds under our Framework will include details on the expected and realized qualitative and, where possible, quantitative environmental and social impacts. Reports will be published on our website and annually renewed until the proceeds of any outstanding sustainable instrument are fully allocated to eligible assets, and as promptly as practicable in case of any material changes in the proceeds allocation thereafter.Sustainability Report 2021External AssuranceGoldman Sachs engages an independent auditor to provide external assurance of our allocation on an annual basis until the proceeds of each issuance is fully allocated to eligible assets. The auditor’s responsibilities include:• Assurance that assets have been appropriately identified as eligible for inclusion.• Assurance that the allocation of funds from each issuance went to eligible green and social projects.

SECTION 4KPI Reporting
SECTION 5Featured Investments
Climate  TransitionAt Goldman Sachs, we are committed to aligning our business with a net zero by 2050 pathway, and we seek to drive decarbonization in the real economy, in partnership with our clients and companies that we invest in. Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and preventing the worst impacts of climate change will require capital, innovation, and coordination across both the public and private sector as businesses across regions and sectors seek to implement low-carbon solutions — and communities everywhere adapt to an increasingly warming world. Clean EnergyCASE STUDY:  PhononicGoldman Sachs invested in Phononic, a global leader in solid-state cooling technology. The company seeks to reform cooling using unique semiconductor technology to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions relative to traditional mechanical compression incumbents. Through its technology platform, Phononic’s innovations could support the transformation of the ways data is communicated; automobiles "see"; grocers merchandise and deliver food; vaccines and drugs are stored and protected; and residential houses and office buildings are cooled.We believe Phononic furthers Goldman Sachs’ broader sustainability commitments, and their solid-state technology is delivering solutions that have not historically been available through legacy thermoelectric or compressor incumbents. Our investment aims to help grow and expand their capabilities to meet anticipated demand.Phononic’s technology and products are important to the way we communicate; feed our families; safeguard and transport life-saving vaccines; and even shop for our favorite ice cream snacks. We believe that this investment is an important example of how innovation and capital can together help support transformative environmental impact.Waste and Materials CASE STUDY:  Oikos GroupWhen Goldman Sachs acquired a majority stake in Oikos, Germany’s second-largest provider of high-quality prefabricated homes in May 2021, we embarked on a journey seeking to further accelerate the decarbonization of the housing industry – an industry with a traditionally considerable carbon footprint. According to the World Green Building Council, the traditional building sector accounts for 36% of all emissions, 40% of energy consumption, and 50% of raw material extraction in the EU 1. While traditional brick and mortar homes can cause significant environmental cost and greenhouse gas emissions during production of the required input factors, Oikos’ homes’ walls and ceiling structures are made from environmentally friendly wood and enjoy around 99% lower CO?/sqm emissions over traditional houses and around 80-90% environmental cost advantage.Within the prefabricated housing industry, Oikos has long been positioned as one of the leaders not just in terms of a state-of-the-art, high-quality modular product range, but also for its sustainability focus along the entire value chain. Starting with the company’s structured assessment of its already high baseline performance in each subcategory of ESG, we identified numerous other initiatives that we believe fully align the company with the emissions reduction goals of the Paris Agreement. For example, by phasing out diesel-powered production vehicles, investing in new heating systems, installing solar photovoltaic systems on its plants, and extending the environmental commitment along the supply chain through purchasing Forestry Stewardship Council / Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification-certified timber from responsibly managed forests, Oikos could further reduce its carbon emissions and is targeting a reduction of 15% Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions per delivered house by 2025 (vs. 2020). The company is also committed to maintaining its current level of 100% renewable energy sourcing. Additionally, Oikos is now actively tracking and reporting production waste per delivered house and is working on initiatives, including a boost in photovoltaic panels adoption within its customer base, to further reduce life cycle CO2 emissions after handing over completed houses to customers. We believe that this continuous improvement on ESG metrics will continue to help differentiate Oikos’ sustainable offering versus its competitors. 1 ? World Green Building Council: "A sustainable built environment at the heart of Europe's future," June 2019. Sustainable Transport CASE STUDY:  NorthvoltAs electric vehicles and renewable energy proliferate, one of the biggest hurdles to mass adoption has been scaling battery manufacturing in a sustainable way. In 2018, we identified that Northvolt, a Stockholm, Sweden-based lithium-ion battery manufacturer, had the potential to bring a new level of sustainability to manufacturing the batteries that power electric vehicles and provide customized energy storage solutions. We believe that the company has a differentiated value proposition: a focus on delivering batteries with a significantly lower carbon footprint than those produced by others, realized through a combination of factories fully powered by hydropower and a vertically integrated production cycle that recycles many of the minerals and raw materials required by lithium-ion batteries.Over the course of a year, we conducted deep diligence on the company and team. Importantly, the company’s CEO and COO were heavily involved in the construction of Tesla’s first “Gigafactory” in the US, bringing critical experience to bear and providing a clear vision for company development. In 2019, we teamed with Volkswagen to lead a $1 billion Series D financing round. As Northvolt executed on its strategy, we helped the company raise $1.6 billion of non-recourse, first- and second-lien debt in 2020 — the first such financing for a battery manufacturer. In 2021, we again partnered with Volkswagen, along with other investors, to invest an additional $2.75 billion of equity — the largest private capital raise in Europe’s history — to help fuel the company’s global expansion and increase capacity at its factory in the far north of Sweden. Thanks to our close relationship with Northvolt, we were able to help the company navigate multiple complex financing transactions at key points in its development.Ecosystem  Services CASE STUDY:  Corvias Infrastructure  SolutionsThrough a partnership with the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewage District, Goldman Sachs provided a loan to Corvias Infrastructure Solutions to finance the development of green stormwater infrastructure systems. The loan is the first closing through a facility that is intended to support Corvias’ construction of similar green stormwater infrastructure in partnership with municipalities across the US. Corvias is a leading developer of public-private partnership infrastructure and real estate projects across  the US, and the company previously retrofitted over 2,000 acres of land as part of work associated with the EPA Clean Water Act.Built in response to federal municipal requirements under the EPA Clean Water Act, the stormwater infrastructure systems provide additional capacity that helps to prevent unwanted pollutants from filtering into groundwater during storm surges. The majority of the systems will be located in low-to-moderate income geographies, and they are expected to help avoid untreated stormwater runoff from polluting  these areas. In addition, Corvias is targeting participation by subcontractors that are small, minority, and women-owned businesses. 
Inclusive GrowthWe recognize that growth must be inclusive to be sustainable. As with the complexity of a transition to a lowcarbon economy, the inclusive growth challenge is far from simple and cannot be solved by a single financial institution. Our approach combines over 20 years of experience investing in underserved communities, learnings from connecting with and listening to the needs of a wide range of diverse communities and partnerships to help drive solutions that improve affordability, access, and quality of life.Communities CASE STUDY:  Sendero VerdeAffordable housing is a critical part of strengthening communities and building resilience for generations to come. Goldman Sachs provided financing for Phase 1 of the development project consisting of 208 affordable housing units plus community facility space in East Harlem, New York. Of the 208 affordable units in Phase 1, 25% will be set aside for formerly homeless households, 17% will be affordable to households earning up to 30% of area median income (AMI), 25% up to 50% of AMI, and the remaining 33% up to 60% of AMI.Phase 1 is part of the broader Sendero Verde project, a 348unit mixed-use development that is being built in response to a public request for proposals issued by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development to develop a formerly vacant lot. Sendero Verde is being built with the goal of achieving “Passive House” energy efficiency standards. Upon completion, Sendero Verde is expected to be the largest fully affordable Passive House development in the world. In addition to the affordable units, the overall project includes community facility space that will be leased to:• Harlem Children’s Zone: a local nonprofit organization focused on breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty through its charter school and preschool programs; and• East Harlem Council for Community Improvement: a local nonprofit organization focused on community advocacy and providing supportive services. Communities  CASE STUDY:  Hinchliffe StadiumBuilt in 1932, Hinchliffe Stadium was a 10,000-seat baseball stadium known most prominently as the home of the New York Black Yankees in the 1930s and 1940s.Goldman Sachs provided a loan through the Passaic County Investment Authority to finance the rehabilitation of Hinchliffe Stadium, an important New Jersey historic and cultural landmark that had fallen into disrepair, as well as the new construction of 75 units of affordable senior housing  for households earning up to 60% of AMI.The rehabilitation is targeted at providing a significant benefit to the Paterson School District and broader Paterson community by enabling Hinchliffe Stadium to once again be used as a sporting event space and cultural hub for residents of the surrounding geography. CASE STUDY:  475 Bay StreetGoldman Sachs provided financing for the groundup construction of 475 Bay Street, a 100% affordable development located in the Stapleton neighborhood of Staten Island, New York. The planned development is a 12-story residential building containing 270 units, 51% of which are to be set aside for formerly homeless seniors. The development will include supportive services, in addition to 9,900 square feet of ground-floor retail space.The development falls within New York City’s Bay Street Corridor Neighborhood Plan, which is part of Housing New York and seeks to create a new mixed-use district that both builds and preserves affordable housing and              provides a range of retail and services in the former manufacturing district.The project was awarded a subsidy from New York State’s Empire State Supportive Housing Initiative that will provide funding for rental subsidies, operating costs, and other costs associated with the supportive services to be provided by Selfhelp Community Services, an 85-year-old organization that provides housing stability for seniors. Together with NYC Department of Homeless Services, Selfhelp will help tenants adjust to independent living, which includes upfront onboarding and ongoing needs assessments, organizing wellness activities, and referring to service providers.
Accessible and Innovative Financial Inclusion  CASE STUDY:  OlistHealthcare CASE STUDY:  NYC COVID-19 Safety Net Hospitals Staffing and Vaccine Loan Facility 
In April 2021, Goldman Sachs invested in Olist, a one-stopshop platform that aims to enable small and mid-sized merchants and brands to sell online by functioning as the storefront to these merchants in the main marketplaces in Brazil. Olist seeks to address the fragmentation, operational complexities, and integration burdens experienced by small and mid-sized merchants in existing marketplaces by offering full stack operational support to merchants through its management of product catalogs, inventory, pricing, fulfillment, customer service, and payments in a single integrated platform.Goldman Sachs participated in the Series E funding that closed in December 2021, where the new capital enabled the company to offer a fulfillment operation as well as financial services. Retailers on Olist already have access to credit lines for working capital, and the company plans to expand that technology to include risk management, accelerated sales, and internal credit models for merchants. The company recently began operations in Mexico and intends to expand its footprint across Latin America.In a public-private partnership with the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYC EDC), Goldman Sachs financed the NYC COVID-19 Hospital Loan Fund to support COVID-19 related staffing and expenses – including wages, child care, and protective equipment – and vaccination efforts at New York City’s safety net hospitals, which are primarily located in low-income neighborhoods and tend to serve the city’s poorest and most vulnerable residents. The loan facility helped enable these recipient safety net hospitals to meet the increasing demand for COVID-19 care by making available funds that could be used to increase the number of staff available to treat COVID-19 surges and administer vaccinations to their patients. While the safety net hospitals are expected to qualify for FEMA Public Assistance reimbursements, the loans helped the hospitals to bridge the timing gap between immediate financing needs and future reimbursements. NYC Emergency Management (NYCEM) and Community Preservation Corporation, a local non-profit Community Development Financial Institution, were both part of the partnership.

These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond our control. These statements relate to, among other things, our goals, targets, aspirations and objectives, and include the use of projections in connection with aggregated key performance indicator (KPI) metrics provided by third parties, and actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward looking statements, including KPI projections. Factors that could cause our results to differ from the forward-looking statements include global socio-demographic and economic trends, energy prices, technological innovations, climate-related conditions and weather events, legislative and regulatory changes, and other unforeseen events or conditions. For more information, see “Forward-Looking Statements” in Part 1, Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (2021 10-K) and in our subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, important factors that generally affect our business and operations can be found under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our 2021 10-K, and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Our approach to the disclosures included in this report differs from our approach to the disclosures we include in our mandatory regulatory reports, including our filings with the SEC. This report is intended to provide information from a different perspective and in more detail than that required to be included in other regulatory reports, including our filings with the SEC.	Sustainability Report 202122INTRODUCTIONSustainability Report 2021	Introduction	4Sustainability Report 2021	Introduction	4Sustainability Report

"The treatment of current liabilities for each company can vary based on the sector or industry. Current liabilities are used by analysts, accountants, and investors to gauge how well a company can meet its short-term financial obligations.",Current liabilities,Liabilities

Accounts Payable,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Accounts payable (AP) are a company's short-term debt obligations to its creditors and suppliers. It appears on the balance sheet under the current liabilities. Accounts payable represents the total amount due to suppliers or vendors for invoices that have yet to be paid.3,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Typically, vendors provide terms of 15, 30, or 45 days for a customer to pay, meaning the buyer receives the supplies but can pay for them at a later date. These invoices are recorded in accounts payable and act as a short-term loan from a vendor. By allowing a company time to pay off an invoice, the company can generate revenue from the sale of the supplies and manage its cash needs more effectively.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Ideally, suppliers would like shorter terms so that they're paid sooner rather than later—helping their cash flow. Suppliers will go so far as to offer companies discounts for paying on time or early. For example, a supplier might offer terms of ""3%, 30, net 31,"" which means a company gets a 3% discount for paying 30 days or before and owes the full amount 31 days or later.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Conversely, companies might use accounts payables as a way to boost their cash. Companies might try to lengthen the terms or the time required to pay off the payables to their suppliers as a way to boost their cash flow in the short term.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Accrued Expenses,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Accrued expenses are costs of expenses that are recorded in accounting but have yet to be paid. Accrued expenses use the accrual method of accounting, meaning expenses are recognized when they're incurred, not when they're paid. ",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Accrued expenses are listed in the current liabilities section of the balance sheet because they represent short-term financial obligations. Companies typically will use their short-term assets or current assets such as cash to pay them.4,Current liabilities,Liabilities

Some examples of accrued expenses include:,Current liabilities,Liabilities
A supply purchase from a vendor but have yet to receive an invoice to pay it,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Interest payments on loans that are due in the near term,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Warranty on a service or product but has yet to be fully paid,Current liabilities,Liabilities

"Accrued federal, state, and local taxes",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Accumulated employee wages, bonuses, and commissions for a period that might be paid at a later date such as the following period",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Taxes Payable,Current liabilities,Liabilities

Income taxes owed to the government that have yet to be paid,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Payroll taxes that have been held from an employee but haven't been paid,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Taxes collected from their customers and paid to the government, which are recorded as sales taxes payable",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Short-Term Debt,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Short-term debt is typically the total of debt payments owed within the next year. The amount of short-term debt as compared to long-term debt is important when analyzing a company's financial health. For example, let's say that two companies in the same industry might have the same amount of total debt.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"However, if one company's debt is mostly short-term debt, it might run into cash flow issues if not enough revenue is generated to meet its obligations.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Also, if cash is expected to be tight within the next year, the company might miss its dividend payment or at least not increase its dividend. Dividends are cash payments from companies to their shareholders as a reward for investing in their stock.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Types of Short-Term Debt,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Commercial paper is also a short-term debt instrument issued by a company. The debt is unsecured and is typically used to finance short-term or current liabilities such as accounts payables or to buy inventory.6,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Short-term debts can include short-term bank loans used to boost the company's capital. Overdraft credit lines for bank accounts and other short-term advances from a financial institution might be recorded as separate line items, but are short-term debts. The current portion of long-term debt due within the next year is also listed as a current liability.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Payroll Liabilities,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Companies may be responsible for payroll liabilities that are due within the year. These liabilities can include Medicare payments withheld for staff. Employer benefits such as retirement plan contributions or health insurance premiums may also constitute current liabilities.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Dividends Payable or Dividends Declared,Current liabilities,Liabilities
The dividends declared by a company's board of directors that have yet to be paid out to shareholders get recorded as current liabilities.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Unearned Revenue,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Unearned revenue is money received or paid to a company for a product or service that has yet to be delivered or provided. Unearned revenue is listed as a current liability because it's a type of debt owed to the customer. Once the service or product has been provided, the unearned revenue gets recorded as revenue on the income statement.2",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Example of Current Liabilities,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Below are some of the highlights from the income statement for Apple Inc. (AAPL) for its fiscal year 2021.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
urrent liabilities totaled $125.483 billion for the period. This is an increase of around $20 billion from the year prior.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Accounts payable was $47.493 billion and is short-term debt owed by Apple to its suppliers.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Commercial paper was $6.0 billion for the period.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Term debt, which is the portion of long-term debt that's owed in the next year was $9.6 billion.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Total current assets came in at $134.836 billion for the quarter, which shows that Apple had ample short-term assets to cover its current liabilities.7",Current liabilities,Liabilities
What Is the Current Ratio?,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"The current ratio is a measure of liquidity that compares all of a company’s current assets to its current liabilities. If the ratio of current assets over current liabilities is greater than 1.0, it indicates that the company has enough available to cover its short-term debts and obligations.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Why Is Accounts Payable a Current Liability?,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Accounts payable (AP), or simply payables, refer to outstanding bills or payments that the company owes to somebody else, such as to a vendor or contractor. These payments must be made within the reporting period and so represent a current liability.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
What Are Some Common Examples of Current Liabilities?,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Some examples of current liabilities that appear on the balance sheet include accounts payable, payroll due, payroll taxes, accrued expenses, short-term notes payable, income taxes, interest payable, accrued interest, utilities, rental fees, and other short-term debts.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Why Are Current Liabilities Important to Investors?,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"The analysis of current liabilities is important to investors and creditors. Banks, for example, want to know before extending credit whether a company is collecting—or getting paid—for its accounts receivables in a timely manner. On the other hand, on-time payment of the company's payables is important as well. Both the current and quick ratios help with the analysis of a company's financial solvency and management of its current liabilities.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Current liabilities are short-term debts. There are many types of current liabilities, from accounts payable to dividends declared or payable. These debts typically become due within one year and are paid from company revenues.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
What is a Current Liability?,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"A current liability is an obligation that is payable within one year. The cluster of liabilities comprising current liabilities is closely watched, for a business must have sufficient liquidity to ensure that they can be paid off when due.  All other liabilities are reported as long-term liabilities, which are presented in a grouping lower down in the balance sheet, below current liabilities.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"In those rare cases where the operating cycle of a business is longer than one year, a current liability is defined as being payable within the term of the operating cycle. The operating cycle is the time period required for a business to acquire inventory, sell it, and convert the sale into cash. In most cases, the one-year rule will apply.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Since current liabilities are typically paid by liquidating current assets, the presence of a large amount of current liabilities calls attention to the size and prospective liquidity of the offsetting amount of current assets listed on a company's balance sheet. Current liabilities may also be settled through their replacement with other liabilities, such as with short-term debt.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Accounting for Current Liabilities,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"The initial entry to record a current liability is a credit to the most applicable current liability account and a debit to an expense or asset account. For example, the receipt of a supplier invoice for office supplies will generate a credit to the accounts payable account and a debit to the office supplies expense account. Or, the receipt of a supplier invoice for a computer will generate a credit to the accounts payable account and a debit to the computer hardware asset account.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Current Liability Usage in Ratio Measurements,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"The aggregate amount of current liabilities is a key component of several measures of the short-term liquidity of a business, including:",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Current ratio. This is current assets divided by current liabilities.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Quick ratio. This is current assets minus inventory, divided by current liabilities.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Cash ratio. This is cash and cash equivalents, divided by current liabilities.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"For all three ratios, a higher ratio denotes a larger amount of liquidity and therefore an enhanced ability for a business to meet its short-term obligations.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
The following are common examples of current liabilities:,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Accounts payable. These are the trade payables due to suppliers, usually as evidenced by supplier invoices.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Sales taxes payable. This is the obligation of a business to remit sales taxes to the government that it charged to customers on behalf of the government.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Payroll taxes payable. This is taxes withheld from employee pay, or matching taxes, or additional taxes related to employee compensation.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Income taxes payable. This is income taxes owed to the government but not yet paid.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Interest payable. This is interest owed to lenders but not yet paid.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Bank account overdrafts. These are short-term advances made by the bank to offset any account overdrafts caused by issuing checks in excess of available funding.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Accrued expenses. These are expenses not yet payable to a third party, but already incurred, such as wages payable.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Customer deposits. These are payments made by customers in advance of the completion of their orders for goods or services.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Dividends declared. These are dividends declared by the board of directors, but not yet paid to shareholders.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Short-term loans. This is loans that are due on demand or within the next 12 months.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Current maturities of long-term debt. This is that portion of long-term debt that is due within the next 12 months.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"The types of current liability accounts used by a business will vary by industry, applicable regulations, and government requirements, so the preceding list is not all-inclusive. However, the list does include the current liabilities that will appear in most balance sheets.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"The current liabilities section of a balance sheet shows the debts a company owes that must be paid within one year. These debts are the opposite of current assets, which are often used to pay for them.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Learn more about how current liabilities work, different types, and how they can help you understand a company's financial strength.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Definition and Examples of Current Liabilities,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Current liabilities are also called ""short-term liabilities."" They are debts that must be paid within the next year, including:",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Short-term debt, such as a line of credit",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Rent for space or equipment,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Bills for goods or services,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Near-term obligations to provide goods or services1,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Adding the short-term and long-term liabilities together helps you find everything that is owed.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Current liabilities can be found on the right side of a balance sheet, across from the assets. In most cases, you will see a list of types of current liabilities and the amount owed in each category. Then, you'll see a total figure that shows all of the current liabilities.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Paying current liabilities is mandatory for a business. To do so, it must balance liabilities against current assets. The difference between these is the company's working capital.2",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Comparing the current liabilities to current assets can give you a sense of a company's financial health. If the business doesn't have the assets to cover short-term liabilities, it could be in financial trouble before the end of the year.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"On the other hand, it's great if the business has sufficient assets to cover its current liabilities, and even a little left over. In that case, it is in a strong position to weather unexpected changes over the next 12 months.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"A balance sheet will list all the types of short-term liabilities a business owes. They can fall into multiple categories, which may change over time.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
1. Accounts Payable,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Accounts payable are the opposite of accounts receivable, which is the money owed to a company. Accounts payable is what the company owes to others. This increases when a company receives a product or service before it pays for it. ",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Accounts payable, or ""A/P,"" are often some of the largest current liabilities that companies face. Businesses are always ordering new products or paying vendors for services or merchandise. ",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Well-managed companies attempt to keep accounts payable high enough to cover all existing inventory. This is listed on the balance sheet as ""assets.""",Current liabilities,Liabilities
2. Accrued Payroll,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"This item on the balance sheet shows money owed to employees, which the company has not yet paid, including:",Current liabilities,Liabilities
3. Short-Term and Current Long-Term Debt,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"These current liabilities are sometimes referred to as ""notes payable."" They are the most important items under the current liabilities section of the balance sheet.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Most of the time, notes payable are the payments on a company's loans that are due in the next 12 months. ",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Using borrowed funds is not always a sign of financial weakness. For instance, a store executive may arrange for short-term loans before the holiday shopping season so the store can stock up on merchandise. If demand is high, the store would sell all of its inventory, pay back the short-term debt, and collect the difference.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"If, on the other hand, the notes payable balance is higher than the total values of cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable, it may be cause for concern.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Unless the company operates in a business in which inventory can be rapidly turned into cash, that may be a sign of financial weakness.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
4. Other Current Liabilities,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Depending on the company, you will see various other current liabilities listed. In some cases, they will be lumped together under the title ""other current liabilities."" ",Current liabilities,Liabilities
You usually can find a detailed listing of what these other liabilities are somewhere in the company's annual report or 10-K filing.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
You may also see entries for:,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Dividends payable: The amount of money that has been approved by the board of directors to be distributed to shareholders in the future.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Interest payable: Money that must be paid in interest to lenders.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Income taxes payable: Money that will have to be paid to the government.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
5. Consumer Deposits,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"If you are looking at the balance sheet of a bank, be sure to look at consumer deposits. In many cases, this item will be listed under ""other current liabilities"" if it isn't included with them. ",Current liabilities,Liabilities
"Consumer deposits show the amount that clients have deposited in a bank. This money is a liability rather than an asset. That's because, theoretically, all of the account holders could withdraw all of their funds at the same time. Their money doesn't belong to the bank.",Current liabilities,Liabilities
Current liabilities are debts a company owes that must be paid within one year. They are often paid with current assets.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Current liabilities can be found on the right-hand side of a balance sheet.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
Compare the current liabilities with the assets and working capital that a company has on hand to get a sense of its overall financial health.,Current liabilities,Liabilities
"They’re important enough to earn their own entry on the company balance sheet, but what are non-current liabilities exactly? The non-current liabilities definition refers to any debts or other financial obligations that can be paid after a year. Typical examples could include everything from pension benefits to long-term property rentals and deferred tax payments.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"By comparing non-current liabilities to cash flow, a business can analyse how well it will be able to meet long-term financial obligations. With stable cash flows, a business can manage a higher debt load over the long term. It’s also important to track these long-term liabilities in order to plan ahead for future investments and asset purchases.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Types of non-current liabilities,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Here are the main types of long-term financial obligations that fall under this category, along with a few non-current liabilities examples.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
1. Long-term borrowings,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Some of the most common non-current liabilities examples are long-term borrowings. These include lines of credit with repayment periods lasting for longer than one year. Businesses typically utilise long-term borrowings to meet their capital expense obligations or fund specific operations. For example, a business might have access to a prespecified line of credit to purchase machinery.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
2. Long-term lease,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Another example of a common non-current liability is a lease payment. Businesses typically sign commercial leases for periods over one year, with prespecified monthly repayments due throughout the duration of this contract. Lease payments might apply to office space or other forms of property, as well as rented equipment including industrial machinery and motor vehicles. Any property purchased using the lease would then be recorded as an asset on the company balance sheet.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
3. Provisions,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"A third type of non-current liability is for provisions, which refers to entries made in the books for unforeseen liabilities. These are likely to occur, although the exact terms may not be known just yet. A few examples of provisions could include things like guarantees, losses, pensions, and severance costs. These might be incurred during the current year but won’t be realised on the balance sheet until next year.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
4. Deferred tax liabilities,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"There’s often a lag between a tax liability and its eventual payment. As a result, deferred tax liabilities often fall under the category of non-current. Using a deferred tax liability lets your business show on record that you’ve reported less income in the current accounting period and will offset this amount in the future.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
5. Loans (secured and unsecured),Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"While loans might seem identical to long-term borrowings, there are a few differences. You can borrow from any entity, but when you take out a secured or unsecured loan from a financial institution this falls under a different category for accounting purposes. Loans are usually longer term in nature, which makes them a prime example of non-current liabilities.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Additional non-current liabilities examples include things like derivative liabilities, bonds, deferred compensation, or product warranties.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
The importance of non-current liabilities in accounting,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Both current and non-current liabilities provide useful information when assessing a company’s financial health. However, there are distinct advantages to taking a closer look at non-current liabilities in accounting. For example, long-term liabilities help measure whether a new venture makes sense for your business. If your cash flow is insufficient to cover future debts, it may not be a good time to take on additional financial obligations.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Business owners, creditors, and investors alike use non-current liabilities when looking at financial ratios. Examples include the debt ratio, interest coverage ratio, and debt to equity ratio. These compare liabilities to assets or equity, giving a quick overview of liquidity.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Non-current liabilities, or long-term debts, are payments that become due after 12 months. Since these obligations aren't due for more than a year, they can come with certain challenges, such as a customer no longer having the finances or the company going out of business. Therefore , non-current debts require steady moderation to ensure that an entity can make its collections successfully after a long period. Too many long-term liabilities can hinder a company's immediate cash flow and impact the appearance of its financial reports.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Companies that take on more financial risk are likely to be more receptive to non-current debts. Businesses that benefit from stable cash flow can support higher debt loads without creating additional risk. Therefore, a proper balance of non-current liabilities and cash flow is ideal for a business to operate moderately.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities

#1 – Long Term Borrowings,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Long Term Borrowings are the acceptance of the funds for the need for meeting capital expenditure and making strategic decisions. Therefore, such funds need to be utilized judiciously and only for the purpose for which it was borrowed—moreover, such funds are to be disclosed at amortized cost per the requirement of IFRS 9.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
#2 – Secured/Unsecured Loans,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"The basic difference between Long term and Secure/Unsecured loans is that borrowings can be from anyone, from a retail investor to NBFCs. At the same time, most of the Loans will come from financial institutions against which assets will be mortgaged based on the structure set up as per the agreed terms and conditions.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
#3 – Long Term Lease Obligations,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Lease payments are the most fundamental and common expenditure a corporation must bear to fulfill its asset requirement. Such lease payments needed to be structured and framed per the IFRS and locally General Acceptable accounting practices. Moreover, the disclosure must also be verified based on the applicable regulations.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Deferred Tax Liabilities,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Deferred Tax Liabilities show that one has disclosed less income in the current year than books of account, and in the future, the arising tax liabilities will be set off against the same. Deferred Tax liabilities must be created to balance the timing differences between books of account and income tax computation. The basic intent is that one cannot claim more gain in tax calculation by adopting different accounting methods and taking less profit to disclose to the concerned department.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
#5 – Provisions,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"As per the matching concept of the accounting principles, all the expenses and revenues must be recognized in the year to which it is attributed. Therefore, even though the expenditure of the 1st year is incurred in the 2nd year, the expenditure of the 1st year is needed to adequately hit the targeted profit and loss account. Hence, to meet this guideline, a concept named provision is accepted under which an amount equivalent to expense will be transferred to a clearing profit and loss account. Hence, to meet this guideline, a concept named provision is accepted under which amount equivalent to expense will be transferred to a clearing account, which will be reversed next year as and when it will be incurred. Provisions may be for one year, five years, or even for more periods.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
#6 – Derivative Liabilities,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Current stock market data is highly flexible. One can create and arrange the transactions based on their needs and earn the gains based on the insights for any specific underlying assets. The main aim of such a derivative instrument is to hedge themselves from the transaction exposure they will face in the future. Therefore, there are full chances of earning loss or profit in a derivative instrument. Derivative instruments must be valued at fair value on every reporting date. Hence, on a fair valuation, if one is getting a mark to market negative, it will be considered derivative liabilities and need to be disclosed in a balance sheet.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities

This can be in the form of a promissory note or some other type of agreement such as a line of credit. A promissory note is a written promise to pay a specific amount of money in principle plus interest, whereas a credit line does not entail a set loan sum.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities

Overview of Balance Sheet,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"A balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a given point in time. The balance sheet is one of the three most important financial statements, along with the income statement and the cash flow statement. The balance sheet is used by investors, analysts, and creditors to assess a company's financial health. The balance sheet can also be used to assess a company's liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities

Example #1 – Long Term Loans Payable,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Company XYZ expanded its business last year. The total estimated cost of the expansion was $500,000. The expansion process lead to an increase in sales for the company. Before the expansion, the company was not so profitable. Company XYZ managed to get a long term loan from the State Bank and offered to pay off $700,000 after 5 years. So the obligation is to pay off $700,000, which will be triggered after 5 years. As 1 year has already passed, so 4 more years are left to the loan payment. The loan amount will be reflected as a long term loan under the company’s Non-Current Liability segment.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Example #2 – Long Term Bonds Issued,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Petrochad is an oil drilling company. Oil drilling setup requires huge capital investment in order to extract oil, transport etc. Capital requirements are often met by issuing bonds in market. Bonds are legal contracts, where the issuer is obligated to pay a predetermined sum of money at a future date in return for a price now. Say that the company petrochad issued long term bonds for 10 years. The Bond value is $1,000,000. So at the end of 10th Year, petrochad needs to arrange $1,000,000 and pay off the bondholders. So the liability is fixed, but it is not current. Petrochad will show the liability in the Non-Current Liability portion of the balance sheet.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Example #3 – Defined Benefit Pension Obligation,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Edward runs a medium sized private company where 500 employees work. The company follows defined benefit pension scheme. Under this scheme, the employees will be paid fixed pension after retirement for the rest of their lives. The fixed pension amount will depend on the last drawn salary during retirement time. So the defined benefit pension plan is a liability for the company. The liability will be triggered once the employees start to retire. The present value of the future liability is the actual pension liability that reflects in the books today. As this is not a current liability, so the amount is reflected under Non-Current Segment.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Example #4 – Life Insurance Sold,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"ABC ltd is an insurance provider. They provide insurance cover for life, houses, cars, etc. Life Insurance is protection that pay a lump sum money when the protection buyer dies. So the claim that can be triggered due to death needs to be paid by the company. The average life expectancy varies from country to country. The liability that may arise due to death is a futuristic event. This is an example of Non-Current liability, where the liability will arise in the future. ABC ltd will make an estimation of the probable insurance claims and show it under the non-current segment of the Liability side.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Example #5 – Deferred Tax Liability,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Deferred Tax occurs when the tax calculated as per tax authority is different than tax calculated as per the company. PFG is a manufacturing company and they hired an accounting firm to calculate the tax for the company. The accounting firm followed accounting standards and calculated the tax amount. When the tax authority calculated the amount, the tax amount was different than what was calculated by the accounting firm. The difference leads to Deferred Tax Liability. The liability will not be paid within 12 years, the discrepancy will reverse slowly. So as the liability is long term, the amount will reflect under the Non-Current side of the Liability.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Example #6 – Long Term Lease Payment,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"UFG shipping company is engaged in transportation. They have a business model in which they don’t buy ships. All the ships that operate are leased by the company. The leases are of long term use. The company typically leases ship for 20 years. As the leases are capital lease, so the liability to pay the lease payment is also long term. In the books of UFG shipping, the lease amount will reflect under Non-Current Liability. Leases are generally for very long periods.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Non-current liabilities are types of liabilities that a business is going to pay after the maturity period of more than 12 months. It is also known as long-term liabilities or long-term debt. The key difference between current liabilities and long-term liabilities is mainly in the terms of payment. Current liabilities are expected to be paid within 12 months, whereas non-current liability has the maturity period usually starts from 12 months to eventually 30 years. Non-current liability is categorized on the balance sheet after current liability.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Example of long-term liabilities,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Long-term debt:,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"When a business borrows money and its payable or maturity period starts after 12 months, it is long-term debt. In a general sense, every non-current liability is long-term debt. When a business needs money for investing or operational purposes, it usually goes for long-term debt because of its flexibility of payment duration.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Deferred tax liabilities:,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"It is a liability that a company must pay in the future. It’s an obligation that must be fulfilled. When tax is recognized to be paid in the next year, not in the current year, it is considered as deferred tax liability in the balance sheet.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Finance lease:,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Finance lease is for leasehold purchase of fixed assets. That's why it is also known as a capital lease. The company that has taken the lease is the user and is responsible for any maintenance work. The lease installment period is usually longer than a year. The company usually will have the option to be the owner of the asset after the successful completion of all lease installments.,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Pension liabilities:,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"If there is a business policy or culture to pay specific amounts for a certain period to certain employees who have gone retirement from the company, that raises the non-current liabilities for the company. The amount is determined based on the company policy, salary, service period, etc.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Non-current liabilities in the balance sheet,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"In the statement financial position, current liabilities and long-term liabilities make the total liabilities which in addition to equity will balance the accounting equation. Total assets equal total liabilities plus equity.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Non-Current liabilities usually categorize after short-term liabilities in the balance sheet.,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"In conclusion, long-term liabilities are liabilities that are expected to be paid after a maturity period of more than one year or longer. It is the company's obligation to settle the liability periodically in the future determined time.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"There are many different types of non-current liabilities for companies. Some common non-current liabilities examples include bank loans, bonds payable, long-term leases, and deferred tax liabilities.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Bank loans: Bank loans are often a type of non-current liability because they are usually paid back over a period of time that is greater than one year. For example, a company may take out a five-year bank loan in order to finance the purchase of new equipment. The company would then be liable for the repayment of the loan over the next five years. This can be in the form of a promissory note or some other type of agreement such as a line of credit. A promissory note is a written promise to pay a specific amount of money in principle plus interest, whereas a credit line does not entail a set loan sum.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Bonds payable: A bond is a debt security that is issued by a company in order to raise capital. The company agrees to pay back the bond over a period of time, usually several years.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Long-term leases: Long-term leases are another type of non-current liability. A lease is an agreement between a lessor and a lessee in which the lessor agrees to let the lessee use an asset, such as a piece of equipment, for a specified period of time. The lessee is then liable for the payment of rent over the term of the lease.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Deferred tax liabilities: Deferred tax liabilities arise when a company's taxable income is greater than its accounting income. This difference is then deferred, or postponed, until the following year.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"There are also many different types of current liabilities that companies may have. Some common examples include accounts payable, payroll liabilities, and income taxes payable.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Accounts payable: Accounts payable is a type of current liability which arises when a company purchases goods or services on credit. The company is then liable for the payment of the debt within a short period of time, usually 30 days.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Payroll liabilities: Payroll liabilities are another type of current liability. These arise when a company pays its employees for work that has been completed. The company is then liable for the payment of taxes and other deductions within a short period of time, usually two weeks.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Income taxes payable: Income taxes payable is a type of current liability which arises when a company has earned income that is subject to tax. The company is then liable for the payment of the tax within a period of time of less than a year.,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"A non-current liability (long-term liability) broadly represents a probable sacrifice of economic benefits in periods generally greater than one year in the future. Common types of non-current liabilities reported in a company’s financial statements include long-term debt (e.g., bonds payable, long-term notes payable), leases, pension liabilities, and deferred tax liabilities. This reading focuses on bonds payable, leases, and pension liabilities.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"This reading is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces bonds and the accounting for their issuance. Section 3 discusses the recording of interest expense and interest payments as well as the amortisation of discount or premium. Section 4 describes fair value accounting for bonds, an alternative to the amortised cost approach. Section 5 discusses the repayment of principal when bonds are redeemed or reach maturity, which requires derecognition from the financial statements. Section 6 covers debt covenants. Section 7 describes the financial statement presentation and disclosures about debt financings. Section 8 discusses leases, including the benefits of leasing and accounting for leases by both lessees and lessors. Section 9 introduces pension accounting and the resulting non-current liabilities.

Summary,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Non-current liabilities arise from different sources of financing and different types of creditors. Bonds are a common source of financing from debt markets. Key points in accounting and reporting of non-current liabilities include the following:,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
The sales proceeds of a bond issue are determined by discounting future cash payments using the market rate of interest at the time of issuance (effective interest rate). The reported interest expense on bonds is based on the effective interest rate.,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Future cash payments on bonds usually include periodic interest payments (made at the stated interest rate or coupon rate) and the principal amount at maturity.,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"When the market rate of interest equals the coupon rate for the bonds, the bonds will sell at par (i.e., at a price equal to the face value). When the market rate of interest is higher than the bonds’ coupon rate, the bonds will sell at a discount. When the market rate of interest is lower than the bonds’ coupon rate, the bonds will sell at a premium.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
An issuer amortises any issuance discount or premium on bonds over the life of the bonds.,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"If a company redeems bonds before maturity, it reports a gain or loss on debt extinguishment computed as the net carrying amount of the bonds (including bond issuance costs under IFRS) less the amount required to redeem the bonds.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Debt covenants impose restrictions on borrowers, such as limitations on future borrowing or requirements to maintain a minimum debt-to-equity ratio.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"The carrying amount of bonds is typically the amortised historical cost, which can differ from their fair value.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Companies are required to disclose the fair value of financial liabilities, including debt. Although permitted to do so, few companies opt to report debt at fair values on the balance sheet.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
A lease is a contract in which a lessor grants the lessee the exclusive right to use a specific underlying asset for a period of time in exchange for payments.,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Leasing is a common arrangement because it has several advantages over purchasing an asset outright: less upfront cash commitment, generally low interest rates, and lower risks associated with ownership such as obsolescence.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Leases are classified as operating or finance leases. Finance leases resemble an asset purchase or sale while operating leases resemble a rental agreement.,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"US GAAP and IFRS share the same accounting treatment for lessors but differ for lessees. IFRS has a single accounting model for both operating leases and finance lease lessees, while US GAAP has an accounting model for each.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Lessees reporting under IFRS and finance lease lessees reporting under US GAAP recognize a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet, equal to the present value of lease payments. The liability is subsequently reduced using the effective interest method and the right-of-use asset is amortized. Interest expense and amortization expense are shown separately on the income statement. The statement of cash flows shows the entire lease payment.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Operating lease lessees reporting under US GAAP recognize a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet, equal to the present value of lease payments. The liability is subsequently reduced using the effective interest method, but the amortization of the right-of-use asset is the lease payment less the interest expense. Interest expense and amortization expense are shown together as a single operating expense on the income statement.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Finance lease lessors (IFRS and US GAAP) recognize a lease receivable asset equal to the present value of future lease payments and de-recognize the leased asset, simultaneously recognizing any difference as a gain or loss. The lease receivable is subsequently reduced by each lease payment using the effective interest method. Interest income is reported on the income statement, typically as revenue, and the entire cash receipt is reported under operating activities on the statement of cash flows.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Operating lease lessors (IFRS and US GAAP): The balance sheet is not affected—The lessor continues to recognize the underlying asset and depreciate it. Lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis on the income statement and the entire cash receipt is reported under operating activities on the statement of cash flows.,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Two types of pension plans are defined contribution plans and defined benefits plans. In a defined contribution plan, the amount of contribution into the plan is specified (i.e., defined) and the amount of pension that is ultimately paid by the plan (received by the retiree) depends on the performance of the plan’s assets. In a defined benefit plan, the amount of pension that is ultimately paid by the plan (received by the retiree) is defined, usually according to a benefit formula.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Under a defined contribution pension plan, the cash payment made into the plan is recognised as pension expense.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Under both IFRS and US GAAP, companies must report the difference between the defined benefit pension obligation and the pension assets as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. An underfunded defined benefit pension plan is shown as a non-current liability.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Under IFRS, the change in the defined benefit plan net asset or liability is recognised as a cost of the period, with two components of the change (service cost and net interest expense or income) recognised in profit and loss and one component (remeasurements) of the change recognised in other comprehensive income.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Under US GAAP, the change in the defined benefit plan net asset or liability is also recognised as a cost of the period with three components of the change (current service costs, interest expense on the beginning pension obligation, and expected return on plan assets) recognised in profit and loss and two components (past service costs and actuarial gains and losses) typically recognised in other comprehensive income.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Solvency refers to a company’s ability to meet its long-term debt obligations.,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"In evaluating solvency, leverage ratios focus on the balance sheet and measure the amount of debt financing relative to equity financing.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"In evaluating solvency, coverage ratios focus on the income statement and cash flows and measure the ability of a company to cover its interest payments.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Definition: Long-term liabilities, or debts due more than a year from now, are referred to as non-current liabilities. A company’s long-term finance relies heavily on long-term obligations. Companies take on long-term debt to secure quick funds for the purchase or investment in new capital assets or projects.",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities

Contingent Liabilities ,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
Contingent liabilities are liabilities that may arise due to the outcome of an unforeseen event in the future,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"As a result, contingent liabilities are liabilities that may occur in the future",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"For instance, if a firm is sued for $100,000 and the action is successful, the company will be liable for the amount of the lawsuit",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"On the other hand, if the effort is unsuccessful, no blame will be established",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"According to accounting standards, a contingent liability is only recognised if the liability is likely to occur (defined as more than 50 per cent likely to happen)",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
It is possible to get a reasonable estimate of the resulting liabilities,Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent Liabilities examples: product warranties, lawsuits ",Non-current liabilities,Liabilities
"Definition: A contingent liability is defined as a liability which may arise depending on the outcome of a specific event. It is a possible obligation which may or may not arise depending on how a future event unfolds. A contingent liability is recorded when it can be estimated, else it should be disclosed.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Description: A contingent liability is a liability or a potential loss that may occur in the future depending on the outcome of a specific event. Potential lawsuits, product warranties, and pending investigation are some examples of contingent liability.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"If the amount can be estimated, the company sets aside that amount separately to be paid out when the liability arises. Contingent liability as a term does not apply only to companies, but to individuals as well.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"For example, if you took an educational loan of Rs 10,00,000 from your bank to fund your child’s higher studies. That amount could well become a contingent liability if your child fails to make monthly payments after getting a job. You might have to pay the amount because you have taken the loan from your bank.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Let’s understand contingent liability from a company’s point of view. Your company might be in the middle of a lawsuit and your lawyer thinks that the other party has a strong case which could potentially lead to damages worth Rs 10 crore.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"In that case, the company would book that amount as contingent liability on its balance sheet. On the other hand, if the lawyer or the legal department thinks that the other party does not have a very strong case in hand. They would advise the firm not to make any provision of a contingent liability.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
When the probability of a contingent liability is low then is no journal or even a disclosure is required in the books of accounts.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent Liability is the company’s potential liability, which depends on the happening or non-happening of some contingent event in the future that is beyond the company’s control. Examples of contingent liabilities include potential pending lawsuits from the company, warranties, etc.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities

A contingent liability refers to the probability of a company incurring a potential liability based on the happening or non-happening of a contingent beyond the company’s control. ,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Various examples of contingent liability include lawsuits, product warranties, changes in government policies, foreign exchange fluctuations, pending cases/investigations, lawsuits of patents, and bank guarantees.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Due to a minor change in government policies, tax rates will change, which will cause a further change in the spending on welfare funds, thus creating a contingent liability in the company’s books.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities

" You are free to use this image on your website, templates, etc., Please provide us with an attribution link",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
#1 – Lawsuit,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
A customer has filed a lawsuit of $100 against a company for providing a defective product and a dented customer service. The company’s legal department believes that the customer has substantial evidence to prove his case and win in a court of law.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"In the above case, there is a possibility that the company may lose this case, and a staggering liability of $100 will arise; therefore, the company will record this liability in its financial statements by debiting the legal expenses and crediting the accrued costs.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Suppose the company believes the customer will not win this case in the above example. Then, the company will have to report a contingent liability in its accounts notes.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
#2 – Product Warranty,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Some companies provide a warranty on their product. For example, suppose a company X Ltd. was selling a car and supplying three years of proof on the vehicle’s engine, which costs around $1,000. However, if the company sells 5000 units, they will have to estimate how many cars may come for engine replacement during the warranty period. Accordingly, the company has to provide contingent liability in its financial statements.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Assume in the above example that the company estimates 25% of cars, i.e., 1250 units, will have to replace the engine; in that case, the company has to provide (1250*$1,000) as their contingent liability.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
#3 – Pending Investigation Or Pending Cases,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Suppose there are pending investigations or court cases against a company. In that case, the company has to disclose contingent liability in its books of accounts.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
#4 – Bank Guarantee,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"There are two companies, X Ltd. and Y Ltd. ",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Suppose Y Ltd. takes a loan of $1,000 million and X Ltd. guarantees Y Ltd’s behalf for that loan. In that case, if Y Ltd., for any reason, fails to make the payment, then X Ltd. will be answerable to the bank. Therefore, X Ltd. has to disclose this contingent liability in its books of accounts.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
#5 – Lawsuit For Theft Of Patent/Know-How,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Suppose ABC Ltd. is a pharmaceutical company developing a formula of medicine that cures diabetes. At the same time, another pharmaceutical company XYZ Ltd. filed a lawsuit of $1,000 million against ABC Ltd. for theft of its patent/know-how. ABC Ltd. feels they will lose the lawsuit and have to pay XYZ Ltd. In that case, ABC Ltd. records this contingent liability in their books of accounts.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
#6 – Change Of Govt. Policies,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Suppose a company has reason to believe there will be a change in government policies due to their product cost getting pricier. It would imply that tax rates change, or the company has to spend some percentage of their profit on welfare funds; thus, the company will have to disclose and note contingent liability in their notes of accounts.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
#7 – Change In Foreign Exchange,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Suppose a company does import-export business by procuring raw materials from one country and supplying finished goods. However, the company must make foreign currency payments, and exchange rates might fluctuate because of global economic conditions. Due to this, the company will have to make more payments to its creditors than its actual cost. As a result, the company will record a contingent liability in its books of accounts. However, the company will receive more money from its debtors than its selling price. Therefore, technically, they will not record this contingent asset in their books of accounts because of accounting principles.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
#8 – Liquidate Damages,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Liquidated damages are an amount of money agreed upon by parties under a contract that one party will pay to others upon breaching the contract. The non-defaulting may file a case and obtain a judgment for the number of liquidated damages; on the other hand, the defaulting party may record/disclose a contingent liability in the books of accounts.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs),Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Are contingent liabilities current liability?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A current liability is a liability the company presently incurs in the accounting books. However, contingent liability is a liability the company expects to incur in the future. ",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
How to record contingent liabilities?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Rules require contingent liabilities to be recorded in the accounts when a future event is likely to occur. Here, one can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A loss (debit) would be recorded, and a liability (credit) would be established before the settlement.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Are contingent liabilities deductible for tax purposes?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A seller cannot claim a tax deduction for contingent liabilities until it comes determinable and fixed. So, one cannot consider it an expenditure while computing taxable income.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
What Is a Contingent Liability?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
A contingent liability is a liability that may occur depending on the outcome of an uncertain future event. Contingent liabilities are recorded if the contingency is likely and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The liability may be disclosed in a footnote on the financial statements unless both conditions are not met.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
KEY TAKEAWAYS,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A contingent liability is a potential liability that may occur in the future, such as pending lawsuits or honoring product warranties.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"If the liability is likely to occur and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the liability should be recorded in the accounting records of a firm.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Contingent liabilities are recorded to ensure that the financial statements are accurate and meet requirements of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"GAAP recognizes three categories of contingent liabilities: probable, possible, and remote.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Pending lawsuits and warranties are common contingent liabilities.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Contingent Liability,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
How Contingent Liabilities Work,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Pending lawsuits and product warranties are common contingent liability examples because their outcomes are uncertain. The accounting rules for reporting a contingent liability differ depending on the estimated dollar amount of the liability and the likelihood of the event occurring. The accounting rules ensure that financial statement readers receive sufficient information.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"An estimated liability is certain to occur—so, an amount is always entered into the accounts even if the precise amount is not known at the time of data entry.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
When Do I Need to Be Aware of Contingent Liability?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"If you run a business or oversee the accounts of one, you need to be aware of the contingent liabilities that you have taken on. You’ll also need to record these. Both GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) require companies to record contingent liabilities in accordance with the three accounting principles: full disclosure, materiality, and prudence.12",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A contingent liability has to be recorded if the contingency is likely and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. GAAP recognizes three categories of contingent liabilities: probable, possible, and remote. Probable contingent liabilities can be reasonably estimated (and must be reflected within financial statements). Possible contingent liabilities are as likely to occur as not (and need only be disclosed in the financial statement footnotes). Remote contingent liabilities are extremely unlikely to occur (and do not need to be included in financial statements at all).",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
What Is Important to Know About Contingent Liability?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent liabilities adversely impact a company’s assets and net profitability. As a result, knowledge of both contingencies and commitments is extremely important to users of financial statements because they represent the encumbrance of potentially material amounts of resources during future​ periods, and thus affect the future cash flows available to creditors and investors.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent liabilities are also important for potential lenders to a company, who will take these liabilities into account when deciding on their lending terms. Business leaders should also be aware of contingent liabilities, because they should be considered when making strategic decisions about a company’s future.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Example of a Contingent Liability,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Assume that a company is facing a lawsuit from a rival firm for patent infringement. The company’s legal department thinks that the rival firm has a strong case, and the business estimates a $2 million loss if the firm loses the case. Because the liability is both probable and easy to estimate, the firm posts an accounting entry on the balance sheet to debit (increase) legal expenses for $2 million and to credit (increase) accrued expense for $2 million.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"The accrual account permits the firm to immediately post an expense without the need for an immediate cash payment. If the lawsuit results in a loss, a debit is applied to the accrued account (deduction) and cash is credited (reduced) by $2 million.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Now assume that a lawsuit liability is possible but not probable and the dollar amount is estimated to be $2 million. Under these circumstances, the company discloses the contingent liability in the footnotes of the financial statements. If the firm determines that the likelihood of the liability occurring is remote, the company does not need to disclose the potential liability.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A warranty is another common contingent liability because the number of products returned under a warranty is unknown. Assume, for example, that a bike manufacturer offers a three-year warranty on bicycle seats, which cost $50 each. If the firm manufactures 1,000 bicycle seats in a year and offers a warranty per seat, the firm needs to estimate the number of seats that may be returned under warranty each year.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"If, for example, the company forecasts that 200 seats must be replaced under warranty for $50, the firm posts a debit (increase) to warranty expense for $10,000 and a credit (increase) to accrued warranty liability for $10,000. At the end of the year, the accounts are adjusted for the actual warranty expense incurred.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
What is a contingent liability?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
A contingent liability is a liability that may occur depending on the outcome of an uncertain future event. A contingent liability has to be recorded if the contingency is likely and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require companies to record contingent liabilities.12,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
What are the 3 types of contingent liabilities?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"GAAP recognizes three categories of contingent liabilities: probable, possible, and remote. Probable contingent liabilities can be reasonably estimated (and must be reflected within financial statements). Possible contingent liabilities are as likely to occur as not (and need only be disclosed in the financial statement footnotes). Remote contingent liabilities are extremely unlikely to occur (and do not need to be included in financial statements at all).",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
What are examples of contingent liability?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Pending lawsuits and warranties are common contingent liabilities. Pending lawsuits are considered contingent because the outcome is unknown. A warranty is considered contingent because the number of products that will be returned under a warranty is unknown.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Is contingent liability an actual liability?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Yes. Although contingent liabilities are necessarily estimates, they only exist where it is probable that some amount of payment will be made. This is why they need to be reported via accounting procedures, and why they are regarded as “real” liabilities.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A contingent liability is a potential liability that may occur in the future, such as pending lawsuits or honoring product warranties. If the liability is likely to occur and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the liability should be recorded in the accounting records of a firm.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent liabilities are recorded to ensure that the financial statements are accurate and meet GAAP or IFRS requirements. GAAP recognizes three categories of contingent liabilities: probable, possible, and remote. Pending lawsuits and warranties are common contingent liabilities.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Definition of Contingent Liabilities,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that may arise in future depending on occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain events.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"To simplify the definition, a contingent liability is a potential liability which may or may not become an actual liability depending on the occurrence of events.  As a result, it is shown as a footnote in the balance sheet and not recognized in par with other components of financial statements.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"The outcome of a long-pending lawsuit, a government investigation into organizations affairs, a threat of expropriation etc.  some of the common examples of contingent liabilities. Even a warranty be considered as a contingent liability.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities

Why do you Provision for Contingent Liability?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"By nature, contingent liabilities are uncertain and for a business, these are the future expenses or outflows that might occur. By providing for contingent liabilities, it gives an opportunity for businesses to asses and be prepared for the situation.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Let’s understand why it is important for a business to provide for contingent liabilities with an example.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"ACE Ltd, a spare part manufacturer located in Mumbai. One of their customers has filed the legal claim against the company for delivering the product which was defective.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Initially, when the customer had reported it to, the company refused to accept the claim and therefore, the customer has filed a legal claim against them.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Let’s analyze the above example and find how to provide for contingent liability and how it helps.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
There is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"In the example of ACE Ltd, the present obligation is the legal claim brought against it by a customer. And the past event is the company delivering the defective product and turning down the claim of the customer.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Here, instead of providing for damages in financial statements, ACE Ltd should disclose it by way of notes to the financial statement. The reason is that the future occurrence of an event may or may not turn into a liability.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
It is likely that an outflow of resources including economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"It is clear in the case of ACE Ltd that the claim against the company, on materialization will involve possible outflow of resources to settle the obligation,",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
An estimate can be reliably made on the obligations.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"In the example of ACE Ltd, the claim will materialize into monetary outflow for the company and the company should reliably estimate such amount.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Here, it becomes necessary to notify it to shareholders and other users of financial statements because the outcome will have an impact on investment related decisions.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"To summarize, providing for contingent liabilities will help the business to track the future obligation owing to the past events, asses the outflow of resources required and estimated amount when the obligation materializes.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
When to Recognize a Contingent Liability?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"In order to recognize the contingent liability, you need to consider the below scenarios. These scenarios are often referred to as types of contingent liabilities.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
 Probable,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Under this scenario, contingent Liability is recorded only when it is probable that the loss will occur, and you can reasonably estimate the amount of loss. Here, “Probable” means that the future event is likely to occur.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Therefore, it is also important to describe the liability in the footnotes that accompany the financial statements.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Possible,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Here, contingent liabilities are recognized only when the liability is reasonably possible to estimate and not probable.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Here, “Reasonably possible” means that the chance for occurrence of an event is more than remote but less than likely.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"To further simplify, the loss due to future events is not likely to happen but not necessarily be considered as unlikely. It could be a situation where the liability is probable, but the amount couldn’t be estimated.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Under this situation, the preparers of financial statements should disclose the existence of contingent Liability in the notes accompanying such financial statements",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Remote,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"In this scenario, the contingent liability is not recorded or disclosed if the probability of its occurrence is remote.  Here, ‘remote’ means the contingencies aren't likely to occur and aren't reasonably possible.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Accounting Rules for Contingent Liability,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
A contingent liability should not itself be recognized in the statement of financial position.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
A contingent liability should be disclosed only under notes to financial statements unless the possibilities of a transfer of economic benefits are remote.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Below table summarizes the different nature of contingencies and their treatment in the financial statement.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities

Potential adverse judgement (cases regarding any financial dispute).,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Contingent liability refers to those liabilities that can incur as an entity and depends on the outcomes of the pending lawsuit. Such liabilities are not recorded in the company’s account and are shown in the company’s balance sheet when they are reasonably and probably estimated as a “worst-case” or “contingency” in the outcome. The extent and nature of the contingent liability can be explained by a footnote. The loss is described as remote or probable. And the ability to recognize is reasonably estimated. ,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Define Contingent Liabilities,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent liabilities are those liabilities that tend to occur in the future depending on an outcome. Such liabilities are recorded when their amount can be estimated. It may or may not be disclosed in a footnote unless it meets both conditions. Some of the common contingent liabilities examples are product warranties, pending investigations, and potential lawsuits. ",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Contingent liabilities meaning also signifies the fact that they change according to the amount of money estimated and their likelihood of occurring in the future. The accounting rules make sure that the readers of the financial statement receive enough information. ,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities

Liquidated Damages,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
The damages that need to be compensated by the party if and when there is a breach in the contract. This amount is decided during the negotiation of a contract. The breach is usually a failure in the contract or not up to the mark performance by the party.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
The liquidated damages are written as legal contracts and are bound by the law.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"In a situation where the real damages are difficult to ascertain, a liquidated damage amount seems appropriate and accepted by both parties.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Lets us understand the concept of liquidated damages with the help of an example.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Supposing the company is coming up with a new product to launch in the market and the product is still in the development stage. The company may need to consult with suppliers and other designers outside the company and this may require a legal contract before the business is done. One of the clauses that are added to the contract is liquidated damages. The company needs to come up with an amount that reflects an approximate value of damage if done. ,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"The new product the company is launching may still be kept discreet as the breach in secrecy may result in huge losses for the company. So if there is a breach of indiscretion, the other party, i.e., a supplier or designer hired may have to pay the liquidated damages.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
A liquidated damages compensation can help in safeguarding the party against future discrepancies.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Legal Liability,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Legal liability simply means answerable to the law. One is legally obligated or responsible for any damages done under the law. If the person or company in question does not take the responsibility, they may be legally sued.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"To understand the concept of legal liability, let us take an example of a business owner.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Supposing a business is selling a certain kind of product, any damage that it can be caused to the buyer before and after it leaves the manufacturing unit is the full responsibility of the owner. If the owner is reluctant to take responsibility for their product, the customer can sue the company. ",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Copyright Infringement,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Copyright infringement is referred to as the use of copyright-protected material without prior permission from the copyright holder. Any use, duplication, or publication of the copyrighted material without the permission of the owner can lead to serious legal charges.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
The companies or even individuals who develop new work or products can register for copyright so that they can take benefit from the profits and retain the original ownership. They can also sell the ownership if they have the copyright to do so.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Others interested in their work can take a license to produce or publish their work. Sometimes the breach in copyright infringement can lead to contingent liabilities.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Let us understand copyright infringement with an example.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Supposing the new technology developed by a certain tech company is used or launched by another company without prior permission, it is counted as stealing one property. This may lead to serious legal problems and the company that developed the technology can press charges against the other party. ",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Pirating a movie or a music album is also another example of copyright infringement.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Trespassing,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"When an individual negligently or intentionally enters the land of another without permission, when clearly instructed not via signboards is referred to as trespassing.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
The party to whom the land belongs can sue the one trespassed even if there is no evident damage done.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Let us understand trespassing with an example.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Supposing a hotel has clearly restricted its boundaries around the property and also has put up a no trespassing sign. If any individual intentionally trespasses into the property, then the hotel can press charges against that individual for the same.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Lawsuit,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities

The party that made the damages either suffer legal action or have to go through with the compensation demanded by the other party.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Let us understand this with an example.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Supposing a new publication publishes a piece of private information or anything that tarnishes the image of a celebrity, then the celebrity can file a lawsuit against the media publication for doing so.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Introduction of Contingent Liability,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent Liabilities examples are liabilities that are dependent on a future outcome. If an uncertain but predicted event happens in the future, then the liability will arise. examples are lawsuit claim, warranties on product, fines imposed, natural disaster, etc.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Explanation,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent Liability examples are examples of liabilities that are not certain and linked to an uncertain event of the future. For a contingent liability to be recorded in the books, there are two conditions that should be met. The chance of the future event that will trigger the liability should be likely and the amount of liability can be measured properly. These leads to several contingent liability examples.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Examples of Contingent Liabilities,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Following are the examples are given below:,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Example #1 – Lawsuit Claim,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Company XYZ is fighting a legal case with Company ABC for 2 years. There was a transaction between both the companies 3 years back, where company ABC was supposed to transfer goods to company XYZ and company XYZ was supposed to pay $500,000 in return. The goods were delivered by ABC on time, but due to heavy rain during transit, few goods were damaged. Company ABC wanted to replace the damaged goods, but Company XYZ didn’t agree for replacement and denied payment to ABC.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Company ABC filed case in court against Company XYZ and demanded the full payment and compensation of $400,000 for the harassment. After 2 years, it seems that Company XYZ is losing the case and a total payment of ($500,000 + $400,000 = $900,000) is to be made to company ABC. As it is nearly certain that Company XYZ will lose the case and the liability amount is $900,000. So Contingent liability can be recorded in books.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Example #2 – Warranty on Product,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Masong Ltd is a mobile phone manufacturing company. They are famous for making mobile phones targeted to elite class. The phone range starts from $1000 and goes up. The latest mobile phone that Masong launched is Alpha III. The price of the phone is $1,500. The Unique Selling Point of Masong’s phone is a complete Replacement warranty within 1 year. If there is any software issue, then Masong promises to completely replace the mobile phones in the market.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Recently there is a bug that is being found in Alpha III, which is causing the mobile phone to heat unnecessarily. More than 500 users reported the incident over social media and other platforms. The CEO of Masong is worried about the bug and he is planning to replace all the Alpha III phones in the market. In total 15,000 sets are already sold with that bug. This is a huge liability and is certain. So the books of Masong will reflect the Contingent liability.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Example #3 – Natural Disaster,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Company XYZ is an American construction company which has got a contract of building the longest bridge in Japan. Japan is prone to earthquakes. The bridge will take approximately 5 years to get completed and most of the parts will be made at a different location and assembled at the site. The area where the bridge will be made is prone to earthquakes, but in last 5 years there has been no sign of earthquakes. As per recent reports published by seismologists, there is high chance of earthquakes in coming years.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"This is a situation where the chance of a future event is quite probable, but the estimation of liability is difficult. The loss can’t be accurately measured. For this reason, the contingent liability can’t be recorded in the books, but can be shown in the Foot Notes.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Example #4 – Unpredictable Losses,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Many US Oil exploration companies have adopted fracking as the mean to extract oil and gas from subterranean rocks, boreholes etc. The process is extremely costly and requires large amount of water. Pressurized water is injected in order to release oil and gas from rocks.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"There are a group of activists who doesn’t support this technique as a huge amount of fresh water is used and it contaminates the water badly. So many groups have filed cases in order to stop the extraction. Oil Extraction companies have already spent a huge amount of money for the setup of the extraction. If any order is passed to stop the extraction, then the companies will incur huge losses.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"In this case, both the certainty of the future event and the expected loss amount is unknown, so the contingent liability can’t be recorded in the books and should be mentioned in footnotes.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Example #5 – Fines Imposed,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Baby products manufacturing companies need to go through several quality measures in order to send the product in market. The quality checks are extremely hard to pass. For this reason, it is seen that companies dealing with baby products end up paying huge penalties to the government every year. There are fines imposed on every breach of quality. So if any company wants to show the predicted fine of the future as the contingent liability, then the fine amount and certainty should be clear. If the company is sure that they have breached a quality standard and a penalty is certainly to be attracted. Then that can be recorded as the Contingent Liability in the books",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Conclusion,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent Liability examples are examples of liabilities that are expected to arise but are not certain. Recording of Contingent liability help management to utilize cash accordingly. If a law suit is expected to go against the company and it will attract a penalty of $500,000, then the management will set aside this amount and utilize the remaining cash in the business. Recording of contingent liability is extremely useful to companies but should be audited properly by auditors. It may happen that a company is recording contingent liability just to avoid taxes. Liability will reduce profit and tax may be saved. So external auditors should be careful.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
What is a Contingent Liability?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A contingent liability is a potential liability that may or may not occur, depending on the result of an uncertain future event. The relevance of a contingent liability depends on the probability of the contingency becoming an actual liability, its timing, and the accuracy with which the amount associated with it can be estimated.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A contingent liability is recorded in the accounting records if the contingency is probable and the related amount can be estimated with a reasonable level of accuracy. The most common example of a contingent liability is a product warranty. Other examples include guarantees on debts, liquidated damages, outstanding lawsuits, and government probes.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Why is a Contingent Liability Recorded?,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Both GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) require companies to record contingent liabilities, due to their connection with three important accounting principles.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
1. Full Disclosure Principle,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"According to the full disclosure principle, all significant, relevant facts related to the financial performance and fundamentals of a company should be disclosed in the financial statements.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A contingent liability threatens to reduce the company’s assets and net profitability and, thus, comes with the potential to negatively impact the financial performance and health of a company. Therefore, such circumstances or situations must be disclosed in a company’s financial statements, per the full disclosure principle.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
2. Materiality Principle,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
The materiality principle states that all important financial information and matters need to be disclosed in the financial statements. An item is considered material if the knowledge of it could change the economic decision of users of the company’s financial statements.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"In this context, the term “material” is basically synonymous with “significant.” A contingent liability can negatively impact a company’s financial performance and health; clearly, the knowledge of it might influence the decision-making of different users of the company’s financial statements.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
3. Prudence Principle,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Prudence is a key accounting concept that makes sure that assets and income are not overstated, and liabilities and expenses are not understated. Since the outcome of contingent liabilities cannot be known for certain, the probability of the occurrence of the contingent event is estimated and, if it is greater than 50%, then a liability and a corresponding expense are recorded. The recording of contingent liabilities prevents the understating of liabilities and expenses.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Using Knowledge of a Contingent Liability in Investing,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Since a contingent liability can potentially reduce a company’s assets and negatively impact a company’s future net profitability and cash flow, knowledge of a contingent liability can influence the decision of an investor.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"An investor buys stock shares in a company to gain a future share of its profits. Since a contingent liability may reduce a company’s ability to generate profits, the knowledge of it can dissuade an investor from investing in the company, depending on the nature of the contingency and the amount associated with it.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Similarly, the knowledge of a contingent liability can influence the decision of creditors considering lending capital to a company. The contingent liability may arise and negatively impact the ability of the company to repay its debt.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Impact of Contingent Liabilities on Share Price,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent liabilities are likely to have a negative impact on a company’s share price, as they threaten to negatively impact the company’s ability to generate future profits. The magnitude of the impact on the share price depends on the likelihood of a contingent liability actually arising and the amount associated with it. Due to the uncertain nature of contingent liabilities, it is difficult to estimate and quantify the exact impact that they might have on a company’s share price.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"The level of impact also depends on how financially sound the company is. If investors believe that the company is in such a solid financial situation that it can easily absorb any losses that may arise from the contingent liability, then they may choose to invest in the company even if it appears likely that the contingent liability becomes an actual liability.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A contingent liability, unless very large, will not affect a company’s share price in a major way if the company maintains a strong cash flow position and is rapidly growing earnings. The nature of the contingent liability and the associated risk play an important role.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A contingent liability that is expected to be settled in the near future is more likely to impact a company’s share price than one that is not expected to be settled for several years. Often, the longer the span of time it takes for a contingent liability to be settled, the less likely that it will become an actual liability.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Per GAAP, contingent liabilities can be broken down into three categories based on the likelihood of occurrence. The first category is the “high probability” contingency, which means that the probability of the liability arising is greater than 50% and the amount associated with it can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. Such events are recorded as an expense on the income statement and a liability on the balance sheet.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"A “medium probability” contingency is one that satisfies either, but not both, of the parameters of a high probability contingency. These liabilities must be disclosed in the footnotes of the financial statements if either of the two criteria is true.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent liabilities that do not fall into the categories mentioned above are considered “low probability.” The likelihood of a cost arising due to these liabilities is extremely low and, therefore, accountants are not required to report them in the financial statements. However, sometimes companies put in a disclosure of such liabilities anyway.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Incorporating Contingent Liabilities in a Financial Model,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
Modeling contingent liabilities can be a tricky concept due to the level of subjectivity involved. The opinions of analysts are divided in relation to modeling contingent liabilities.,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"As a general guideline, the impact of contingent liabilities on cash flow should be incorporated in a financial model if the probability of the contingent liability turning into an actual liability is greater than 50%. In some cases, an analyst might show two scenarios in a financial model, one which incorporates the cash flow impact of contingent liabilities and another which does not.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities

Summary,Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"The accounting of contingent liabilities is a very subjective topic and requires sound professional judgment. Contingent liabilities can be a tricky concept for a company’s management, as well as for investors. Judicious use of a wide variety of techniques for the valuation of liabilities and risk weighting may be required in large companies with multiple lines of business.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Sophisticated analyses include techniques like options pricing methodology, expected loss estimation, and risk simulations of the impacts of changed macroeconomic conditions.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities
"Contingent liabilities should be analyzed with a serious and skeptical eye, since, depending on the specific situation, they can sometimes cost a company several millions of dollars. Sometimes contingent liabilities can arise suddenly and be completely unforeseen. The $4.3 billion liability for Volkswagen related to its 2015 emissions scandal is one such contingent liability example.",Contingent liabilities,Liabilities

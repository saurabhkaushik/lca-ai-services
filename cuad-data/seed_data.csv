Property leases, A landlord may require a tenant to provide indemnity against damages should anyone get injured on the premises.
Construction agreements, This would typically include the example mentioned earlier where a contractor uses a subcontractor to perform certain services.
Equipment leases," Here, the owner of the equipment may require the lessee to provide indemnity against damages as a result of using the equipment under the equipment lease ."
Easements," Here, the landowner may require the rights holder for indemnification against any damages suffered on the property or as a result of the use of the easement."
Accounts payable," These are the yet-to-be-paid bills to the company’s vendors. Generally, accounts payable are the largest current liability for most businesses."
Interest payable," interest expense that has already been incurred but has not been paid. Interest payable should not be confused with interest expense, which is the expense on an income statement. "
Income taxes payable," the income tax amount owed by a company to the government. The tax amount owed must generally be payable within one year. Otherwise, the tax owed would be classified as a long-term liability."
Bank account overdrafts," effectively, a type of short-term loan provided by a bank when a payment is processed with insufficient funds available in the bank account"
Accrued expenses," expenses that have been incurred but no supporting documentation (e.g., invoice) has been received or issued to the company by the vendor"
Deferred revenue, (also called unearned revenue). Generated when a company receives early payment for goods and/or services that have not been delivered or completed yet.
Short-term loans or current portion of long-term debt, loans or other borrowings with a maturity of one year or less
Bonds payable," The amount of outstanding bonds with a maturity of over one year issued by a company. On a balance sheet, the bonds payable account indicates the value of the company’s outstanding bonds."
Notes payable," The amount of promissory notes with a maturity of over one year issued by a company. Similar to bonds payable, the notes payable account on a balance sheet indicates the value of the promissory notes."
Deferred tax liabilities," These arise from the difference between the amount of tax recognized on the income statement and the actual tax amount due to be paid to the appropriate tax authorities. As a liability, it essentially means that the company “underpays” the taxes in the current period and will “overpay” the taxes at some point in the future."
Mortgage payable/long-term debt," If a company takes out a mortgage or a long-term debt, it records the value of the borrowed principal amount as a non-current liability on the balance sheet."
Leases, Leases are recognized as a liability when a company enters into a long-term rental agreement for property or equipment. The lease amount is the present value of the lessee’s obligation.
Wages Payable," The total amount of accrued income employees have earned but not yet received. Since most companies pay their employees every two weeks, this liability changes often."
Interest Payable," Companies, just like individuals, often use credit to purchase goods and services to finance over short time periods. This represents the interest on those short-term credit purchases to be paid."
Dividends Payable," For companies that have issued stock to investors and pay a dividend, this represents the amount owed to shareholders after the dividend was declared. This period is around two weeks, so this liability usually pops up four times per year, until the dividend is paid."
Unearned Revenues, This is a company's liability to deliver goods and/or services at a future date after being paid in advance. This amount will be reduced in the future with an offsetting entry once the product or service is delivered.
Liabilities of Discontinued Operations," This is a unique liability that most people glance over but should scrutinize more closely. Companies are required to account for the financial impact of an operation, division, or entity that is currently being held for sale or has been recently sold. This also includes the financial impact of a product line that is or has recently been shut down."
Warranty Liability," Some liabilities are not as exact as AP and have to be estimated. It’s the estimated amount of time and money that may be spent repairing products upon the agreement of a warranty. This is a common liability in the automotive industry, as most cars have long-term warranties that can be costly."
Contingent Liability Evaluation, A contingent liability is a liability that may occur depending on the outcome of an uncertain future event.
Deferred Credits," This is a broad category that may be recorded as current or non-current depending on the specifics of the transactions. These credits are basically revenue collected before it is recorded as earned on the income statement. It may include customer advances, deferred revenue, or a transaction where credits are owed but not yet considered revenue. Once the revenue is no longer deferred, this item is reduced by the amount earned and becomes part of the company's revenue stream."
Post-Employment Benefits," These are benefits an employee or family members may receive upon his/her retirement, which are carried as a long-term liability as it accrues. In the AT&T example, this constitutes one-half of the total non-current total second only to long-term debt. With rapidly rising health care and deferred compensation, this liability is not to be overlooked."
Unamortized Investment Tax Credits (UITC)," This represents the net between an asset's historical cost and the amount that has already been depreciated. The unamortized portion is a liability, but it is only a rough estimate of the asset’s fair market value. For an analyst, this provides some details of how aggressive or conservative a company is with its depreciation methods."
Debt Ratio, The debt ratio compares a company’s total debt (long term plus short term) with its total assets.
Debt to equity ratio, This ratio also gives an idea of the leverage of a company. It compares a company’s total liabilities to its total shareholders’ equity.
Capitalization ratio," This ratio specifically compares a company’s long-term debt and the total capitalization (i.e., long-term debt liabilities plus shareholders’ equity)."
Cash flow to total debt ratio, This ratio gives an idea about a company’s ability to pay its total debt by comparing it with the cash flow generated by its operations during a given period.
Interest coverage ratio, An interest coverage ratio gives an idea about the ability of a company to pay its debt by using its operating income. It is the company earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) ratio to the company’s interest expenses for the same period.
Current Ratios and Quick Ratios, The current and quick ratios are significant among other ratios used to analyze the short-term liabilities. Both help an analyst determine whether a company can pay off its current liabilities.
Interest Coverage Ratio, The interest coverage ratio is used to assess whether a company is generating sufficient income to cover interest payments. The ratio is obtained by taking the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and dividing it by the interest expense incurred in a given period. A higher coverage ratio means that the business can comfortably handle its interest payments and take on additional debt.
Debt Ratio," The debt ratio compares a company’s total debt to total assets to determine the level of leverage of a company. It shows the portion of the company’s capital that is financed using borrowed funds. The lower the percentage, the less leverage a company has, and the stronger its equity position."
Credit lines," A credit line is an arrangement between a lender and a borrower, where the lender makes a specific amount of funds available for the business when needed. Instead of getting lump-sum credit, the business draws a specific amount of credit when needed up to the credit limit allowed by the lender."
Long-term lease," Lease payments are common expenditures that companies are required to meet to fulfill their purchase commitments. Companies use capital leases to finance the purchase of fixed assets, such as industrial equipment and motor vehicles."
Bonds payable," A bond is a long-term lending arrangement between a lender and a borrower, and it is used as a means of financing capital projects. Bonds are issued through an investment bank, and they are classified as long-term liabilities if the payment period exceeds one year. The borrower must make interest payments at fixed amounts over an agreed period of time, usually more than one year."
Notes payable," A note, also called a promissory note, is a special type of loan arrangement where a borrower makes an unconditional promise to pay back the principal plus interest to the lender. The promissory note is used to finance the purchase of assets such as machinery and buildings. If the maturity period of the note exceeds one year, it is considered a non-current asset."
Deferred tax liabilities," Deferred tax liabilities refer to the amount of taxes that a company has not paid in the current period, and that are required to be paid in the future. The liability is calculated by finding the difference between the accrued tax and the taxes payable. Therefore, the company will be required to pay more tax in the future due to a transaction that occurred in the current period for which tax has not been remitted."
Long-term borrowings," From the accounting perspective, long-term borrowings can be defined as the financial assistance that business entities avail in the form of credit. Typically, the repayment period for these kinds of borrowings is over a year. These borrowings are usually availed with the purpose to meet capital expenses. Additionally, they are also used when implementing strategic decisions about improving a firm’s operational scope or quality."
Long-term lease obligations," These non-current liabilities are among the most common and vital expenses incurred by a business entity. Generally, such expenses help business entities to meet the asset-oriented requirements of a company effectively. It must be noted that the payments directed towards these financial obligations are to be made as per IFRS’s norms and guidelines. Similarly, the General Acceptable Accounting Practices guidelines must also be considered while paying off these non-current liabilities. Likewise, business entities need to get their disclosure verified as per the latest applicable regulations."
Secured and unsecured loans," Most business ventures tend to rely heavily on both secured and unsecured loans to meet their various daily operational requirements. For instance, business owners may avail a substantial loan amount to expand their existing business operation, to improve its operational efficiency, or more. Since such borrowings have to be repaid within a predefined period in the future usually extending over a year, they form a part of non-current liabilities. Though there is a striking similarity between long-term borrowings and loans, these terms are not interchangeable when it comes to classifying the non-current liabilities list."
Provisions," As per the fundamental accounting principles, all individuals must acknowledge their aggregate expenses and revenue for a financial year in their accounting books. To further ensure the accuracy of the current year’s accounting balances, a provision is made to the books for unforeseen financial liabilities which are likely to occur.It tends to help entities account for expenses that are incurred in the current year but would be realised in the following year. Notably, such provisions are not to be confused with general savings as their prime motive is to help formulate a more accurate and feasible profit and loss account statement."
Deferred tax liabilities," These non-current liabilities are created to bridge the time gap between the accrual of tax and its payment. Different accounting methods are used to achieve it, and income disclosure takes into account this differential payment over time. This way, deferred tax liabilities indicate that entities account for the tax liabilities in a different timetable than the fulfilment of tax obligations, thus impacting the income. Based on this long-term liability, the tax liability of a business venture is set off over a pre-decided number of financial years."
Derivative liabilities," Share issuing companies mostly have to account for these types of liabilities. Typically, such liabilities arise when a company’s derivative instruments stand at a mark to negative market value. Consequently, the derivative instruments are considered to be a liability and are treated accordingly in the accounting books."
Other non-current liabilities," Typically, other non-current liabilities can be described as a group of long-term liabilities that cannot be explicitly identified under non-current liabilities. The most common examples of such financial obligations include bonds, product against warranty, deferred compensation, revenues and pension liabilities."
Debt ratio," The said ratio compares a company’s aggregate liabilities to its total assets and tends to offer a fair idea of how often it resorts to liability leveraging. A lower percentage indicates that a company is reducing this leverage and has a firm footing for equities. Similarly, a higher ratio indicates that it is more likely to be exposed to financial risk."
Debt to equity ratio, The ratio is arrived at by comparing the total equity of a venture to its total debt. A significantly high ratio signifies that a business venture is not being funded with enough equity. Business owners may take a cue from such outcomes and meet the shortcomings accordingly.
Cash flow to debt ratio, This ratio helps gauge how readily a business venture can pay off its existing debt by utilising its cash flow.
Long-term borrowings," Some of the most common non-current liabilities examples are long-term borrowings. These include lines of credit with repayment periods lasting for longer than one year. Businesses typically utilise long-term borrowings to meet their capital expense obligations or fund specific operations. For example, a business might have access to a prespecified line of credit to purchase machinery."
Long-term lease," Another example of a common non-current liability is a lease payment. Businesses typically sign commercial leases for periods over one year, with prespecified monthly repayments due throughout the duration of this contract. Lease payments might apply to office space or other forms of property, as well as rented equipment including industrial machinery and motor vehicles. Any property purchased using the lease would then be recorded as an asset on the company balance sheet."
Provisions," A third type of non-current liability is for provisions, which refers to entries made in the books for unforeseen liabilities. These are likely to occur, although the exact terms may not be known just yet. A few examples of provisions could include things like guarantees, losses, pensions, and severance costs. These might be incurred during the current year but won’t be realised on the balance sheet until next year."
Deferred tax liabilities," There’s often a lag between a tax liability and its eventual payment. As a result, deferred tax liabilities often fall under the category of non-current. Using a deferred tax liability lets your business show on record that you’ve reported less income in the current accounting period and will offset this amount in the future."
Loans (secured and unsecured)," While loans might seem identical to long-term borrowings, there are a few differences. You can borrow from any entity, but when you take out a secured or unsecured loan from a financial institution this falls under a different category for accounting purposes. Loans are usually longer term in nature, which makes them a prime example of non-current liabilities."

We are also helping our multinational clients who have decided to wind down their business in Russia.\\nAlthough it might be too early to predict the warÕs long-term impact on the world order, itÕs not too soon to begin asking what it means for the issues at the heart  of our ESG agenda Ñ and the ESG agendas of so many other companies.\\nI recently returned from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, and it is security Ñ be it energy, food, defense, cyber or operational Ñ thatÕs now consuming their attention. The challenges facing our society have not only reinforced the need for businesses such as Citi to step up, but also the critical importance of collaboration on  a global scale.\\nConsider the climate crisis. At Citi, weÕve been proud to play a leading role in our industryÕs drive to a more sustainable future, and in recent months, we released our initial plan for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. But RussiaÕs role as a major energy producer is forcing governments to reevaluate their energy security and supply. Ultimately, combating climate change cannot be done by any company or country alone; we need businesses making the right investments to achieve the necessary shift in supply, and consumers joining companies in advocating for governments to create the policy frameworks that will be essential to stimulating demand for clean technologies and providing the foundation for the clean energy transition.\\nThis tension, of course, is not new. While Citi plays an enabling role in the transition to a net zero economy, we understand that it cannot occur overnight. We have to be thoughtful with the transition, meeting our clients where they are in their efforts, and then helping and pushing them to accelerate their low-carbon transitions. \\nSimilarly, our efforts to expand financial access and opportunity have also gained new urgency. We have engaged every level of our business to think and act in support of equity and the goal of helping close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States. In order to effectively do this work and serve our clients and communities, weÕve set Ñ and recently exceeded Ñ talent representation goals to further diversify our own workforce and make progress toward pay equity at Citi. \\nWe also continue to advance financial inclusion in underserved communities globally, expanding the scope of our work to areas such as healthcare, education, affordable housing and basic infrastructure. These efforts have become even more important amidst surging inflation and an emerging global food crisis that could be devastating for the worldÕs poorest countries, which import much of their food and where households spend more than half of their income on food.\\nThere are, of course, lessons to learn and  apply to these challenges, particularly from the pandemic. COVID-19Õs disregard for borders underscored the interconnectedness of society. It also reminded us that global challenges demand a global, collective response. As the world becomes more fragmented, it is even more important for our global community of business to come together to confront the big challenges of our time.\\nAt Citi, this sense of responsibility is something that continues to shape our decisions, business strategy, and firm-wide goals and commitments. We continue to be focused on action and partnering with like-minded organizations that are also doing the work. And for us, itÕs not just about the big numbers; itÕs the small number Ñ helping society get closer to zero. Zero carbon emissions. Zero wealth gap. Zero pay gap. Zero poverty. Some might say this is idealistic, but having ambitious goals is what helps us make meaningful progress. And itÕs going to take all of us, working together, to make sure we continue to go  in the right direction. \\nI invite you to learn more about these initiatives in the pages that follow. Our ESG agenda is not a separate layer that sits above what we do day-to-day. It is an effort that we began at Citi many years ago that has become core to who we are as a company and our daily worth as a bank. While our efforts will continue to evolve to reflect new global challenges, our commitment to transparency and accountability will remain constant. We will continue to share our progress and lessons learned, and we will continue to innovate and push to use our core capabilities, expertise and talent to lead by example and demonstrate how Citi  is truly a bank with a brain and a soul.\\n\\nJANE FRASER \\nChief Executive Officer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNET ZERO\\nLeading Transition  \\n Finance to a    Net Zero Future\\nAs\ta\tglobal\tbank\twith\tbold,\tpublic\tcommitments\tto\thelp\ttackle\tclimate\tchange,\twe\tare\toften\tasked\tthe\tquestion:\tÒWouldnÕt\tit\tbe\tbetter\tfor\tthe\tclimate\tto\tdivest\tfrom\tthe\tfossil\tfuel\tindustry?Ó\tWhat\tappears\tat\tfirst\tglance\tto\tbe\ta\tstraightforward\tquestion\tis\ta\tmore\tcomplex\tissue\tthat\tis\toften\toversimplified.\tClimate\tscience\ttells\tus\tthat\tin\torder\tto\tlimit\tglobal\twarming\tto\t1.5¼C\tabove\tpre-industrial\tlevels,\twe\tmust\treach\tnet\tzero\tgreenhouse\tgas\t(GHG)\temissions\tby\t2050\tÑ\twhich\trequires\t\tus\tto\tcollectively\treduce\temissions\twhile\talso\taccelerating\tclean\tenergy\tsolutions.\tThat\tis\texactly\twhat\tCiti\tis\tfocused\t\ton\tdoing,\tand\tas\ta\tglobal\tbank,\tour\tjob\tis\tto\thelp\tour\tclients\tdo\tthe\tsame.\\nVAL SMITH &A JASON REKATE \\nChief Sustainability \\nOfficer\\nGlobal Head of Corporate  \\nInvestment Banking\\n\\nQ: Why doesnÕt CitiÕs net zero approach include plans for divestment?\\nSmith: A net zero plan is predicated on the idea that we will transition different sectors of the global economy to net zero emissions within specified timeframes. The key concept here is transition, which means reducing GHG emissions to as close to zero as possible by mid-century, and charting that path with the aid of climate science-aligned emissions targets between now and 2050. For Citi, weÕve started by establishing interim 2030 targets for our Energy and Power sector loan portfolios to help us meet our 2050 net zero commitment. \\nDivestment of certain sectors Ñ such as fossil fuels Ñ implies that there is no possibility of a low-carbon transition for these sectors. CitiÕs view is that this transition is not only possible, but also essential, to achieve the economy-wide GHG reductions we need. ItÕs our role and responsibility to work with our clients and help them find more low-carbon ways to do business. \\nRekate: In fact, our clients are looking to us to advise and partner with them on transition strategies. We have the opportunity to provide the resourcing, capital and expertise they need to decarbonize their businesses responsibly. Divestment would leave many of our clients who otherwise need our help with less capacity and incentive to make that transition. Given the size, scale and globality of Citi, we can offer better prospects for achieving net zero together by staying engaged in this work with our clients, rather than exiting it. After all, being a dependable and reliable partner  for our clients, and helping them to navigate challenges, is  a hallmark of our business.\\nQ: What does a responsible and orderly transition look like? \\nSmith: The reality is that the world has significant needs for energy, and although we are beginning to decarbonize, we currently rely on high-emissions energy sources to power the global economy. Different countries are in different stages  of development, so the transition cannot happen in the same way or at the same pace for everyone across the globe. \\nWeÕre particularly focused on how we can help developing countries make the transition, while also meeting their current economic and social needs. We know that many low- and moderate-income communities are also often the most vulnerable and disproportionately impacted by climate change, which presents a dual dilemma Ñ how can they continue to develop in a lower-carbon way, while also increasing their resiliency to potential climate shocks? We want to support their transition in a way that minimizes economic disruption and unintended social consequences, such as economic dislocation and negative impacts on labor forces. \\nRekate: This kind of economic disruption is precisely what would happen with short-term fossil fuel divestment. We donÕt currently have sufficient replacement sources of energy or alternative technologies for both developed and developing countries to step away from all the fossil fuels we use. We need to make the investments that will drive these technological advancements Ñ especially in developing markets that produce energy, like India and Brazil Ñ and also lower the development costs before they can be used in a meaningful way. We also need to take into account current world events and the impacts they have on energy resources and costs, just as weÕre seeing now with the continuing conflict in Russia and Ukraine.\\nAs our clients look to divest from or retire carbon-intensive assets, we also need to consider how to help them do that responsibly. While certainly not easy, the overall goal is to reduce emissions, rather than simply changing ownership. \\nQ: How are we working with our clients, and what kinds of conversations are  we having with them?\\nRekate: The transition wonÕt look the same for all our clients, and thatÕs why we are engaging client by client, sector by sector. WeÕve already begun having conversations with our clients to better understand where they currently are, their climate exposure profiles, and their perspectives on making the transition. Our client engagement and assessment process takes into account various considerations for how weÕll work with our clients Ñ for example, will they publicly disclose their emissions? What are their near- and long-term transition opportunities? Are they willing to partner with us on a transition plan? We expect these kinds of discussions to deepen as we work towards our 2030 targets.\\nWhile this work is still in early stages, IÕm encouraged by the level of interest and engagement weÕve seen so far. Many  of our clients understand the advantages of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, and they are looking to work with us on solutions that will help them reinvest capital into cleaner forms of energy, or even fundamentally change their business models. \\nSmith: This area of work represents a major pivot for us. The way we talk to our clients about their businesses and decarbonization efforts has really evolved, and itÕs an exciting time to be helping to support this change. \\nQ: How is Citi uniquely positioned to be  the leading transition bank?\\nSmith: CitiÕs net zero commitment builds on a sustainability track record of more than two decades, which is a substantial amount of time in the ESG space. WeÕve been setting and meeting increasingly ambitious climate goals and commitments over the years. As a result, the building blocks needed to reach net zero by 2050 are deeply integrated in our business, with the critical support and engagement of our CEO. ItÕs a commitment we take very seriously, because as the worldÕs most global bank, we see a real opportunity to help drive the transition on a global scale. \\nRekate: Not only are we the most global bank, we also deal with a large number of clients across Energy, Power and other sectors that will be working intensively on their transitions for years to come. Being helpful to these clients necessarily means that we must continue building our toolbox of client offerings, developing new products and structuring our business to optimize this work.\\nFor example, in our Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory business unit, we have a dedicated team of bankers who are specifically helping our clients to transition. We also combined the knowledge and expertise of existing teams to form the Natural Resources & Clean Energy Transition team, to more effectively drive client engagement efforts in the energy, power and chemicals sectors. \\nQ: What are some of the biggest  challenges and opportunities over  the next few years?\\nRekate: Perhaps the biggest challenge weÕre currently faced with is limited data. This includes the quantification of emissions associated with our clients, which is essential to understanding how our clients are planning to transition. As the availability and quality of data continue to improve, weÕll be better positioned to assess, make decisions and execute  on our decisions. \\nSmith: Since climate data, disclosure and technologies continue to evolve, there is no rulebook for what a good transition plan looks like. Despite this uncertainty, we are forging ahead to pursue our net zero commitment given the urgency of the climate crisis. Each step of our journey is a learning experience and an opportunity for progress Ñ even if results are not realized right away. As we learn, weÕll continue to share our progress, because transparency and accountability are cornerstones of our work.\\nThereÕs also a critical opportunity for governments to enact strong climate policy and create the environment we need  to accelerate our efforts and meet our climate commitments. We need policies that drive consistent standards for climate disclosure globally, send the appropriate price signals, create the right incentives, and ultimately level the playing field in this collective effort to reach net zero.\t\\n\\nÑ\\nGiven the size, scale and globality of Citi, we can offer better prospects for achieving net zero together by staying engaged in this work with our clients, rather than exiting it.\\n\\n\\n\\nTALENT & DEI\\nDriving Diversity,  \\n Equity and Inclusion    is More Critical        Than Ever \\nThe\tCOVID-19\tpandemic\tand\tthe\tdisproportionate\timpact\ton\tcommunities\tof\tcolor,\tthe\tmurder\tof\tGeorge\tFloyd,\tthe\tresurgence\tof\tanti-Asian\thate,\tthe\tchallenges\tworking\tparents\tface\tbalancing\tthe\tneeds\tof\twork\tand\thome,\tmental\thealth\tstruggles,\tan\tincrease\tin\tanti-LGBTQ+\tlegislation\tand\tthe\twidening\tracial\twealth\tgap\tÑ\tthese\tissues\tand\tevents\twithin\tthe\tpast\tfew\tyears\thave\thighlighted\tsocietal\tinequities\tand\tserved\tas\ta\tcatalyst\tfor\treal\tchange,\tfundamentally\tshifting\thow\twe\ttalk\tabout\tand\ttake\taction\taround\tdiversity,\tequity\tand\tinclusion\t(DEI)\tissues.\t\\n\\nWhen I started working on Wall Street about 30 years ago, the conversation around DEI was practically nonexistent within banking. But today, weÕre past the point of making a case for DEI, and we recognize itÕs foundational to how we do business and impacts the bottom line. \\nInstitutionalizing DEI is core to our business and culture at Citi, and itÕs not only evident in what  we say but it is clear in what we do. As the worldÕs most global bank, effectively integrating DEI requires a data- and business-driven strategy to enable growth and progress. Data tells a story and can influence peopleÕs thinking more so than anecdotes can. Also, our efforts are fueled by transparency and accountability, which we embed across our ESG and DEI work Ñ including our  track record of disclosure and publicly setting measurable goals for our initiatives, like pay  equity and aspirational diverse representation goals, respectively. \\nThis approach has enabled us to make progress on our talent and DEI initiatives over the years. Our executive management team reflects the diversity of our employee and client populations, and we have exceeded gender parity on our board of directors. Our recently promoted Managing Director (MD) class was the most diverse ever. Over a third of the class were women and over a third in the United States were racial/ethnic minorities, and the MD class also included members of the LGBTQ+, Veteran and Disability communities. \\nSo what are some of our top priorities for 2022? \\n¥ Continuing to lead with transparency \\nTo promote credibility and effectiveness in reaching our goals, weÕll continue to break down barriers and be open and transparent about where there are gaps and opportunities for improvement across our talent and DEI initiatives. This includes representation and promotion metrics, progress on pay equity and our participation  in the Management Leadership for Tomorrow Black Equity at Work certification. ItÕs also important to continue updating our key stakeholders about our advancements along the way and to welcome diverse opinions and constructive feedback to strengthen our work. \\n¥ Extending our track record of accountability \\nCorporate policies, measurement and metrics are the cornerstone to a successful talent and DEI strategy, and itÕs critical to publicly set clear, measurable goals to hold ourselves accountable on progress. So, we will continue our efforts on this front, including expanding our aspirational representation and recruitment goals to new markets and underrepresented groups; embedding DEI goals in our executive scorecards; and participating in industry benchmarking surveys, including the Human Rights CampaignÕs Corporate Equality Index, BloombergÕs Gender Equality Index, Disability:INÕs Disability Equality Index and the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility Corporate Inclusion Index (CII). \\n¥ Fostering more inclusion and allyship \\nEngaging diverse perspectives from our people, our clients and the communities we serve across the world not only enriches how we do business but will also help us build our next generation of leaders at the firm. This includes developing inclusive leaders; strengthening our employee networksÕ programming; empowering allies (e.g., bystander and intervention training to stop AAPI hate); and deepening our relationships with diverse suppliers, professional development organizations, and community partners Ñ all with a goal of embracing and empowering different dimensions of diversity and identity. \\nWe recently met and exceeded our representation goals for women globally and Black talent in the United States, and we have no plans of stopping our commitments on this front Ñ weÕll set new, aspirational representation and recruiting goals that will expand to new markets and additional underrepresented groups later this year. At Citi, we have built a solid foundation of talent and DEI work, and weÕre proud of the progress weÕve made and the opportunity to build on it in the future. \\nThe globality of our bank allows us to glean perspectives from different cultures, races/ ethnicities, and backgrounds, while also advancing issues that are important to our people, clients and the communities we serve. ItÕs important we have globally consistent practices that seamlessly integrate the needs across talent and DEI to  help us recruit, attract and retain professionals who are reflective of diversity in all its forms. \\n\\nAnd as Citi builds on these priorities, success will be measured by how well our talent and DEI initiatives are aligned with the business and operations of  our products and functions globally. Establishing the blueprint for globally-consistent talent and  DEI practices for the firm and operationalizing a delivery mechanism for a data-driven and centralized talent and DEI practice will ensure we have a diverse pipeline of future leaders engaged around our commercial efforts globally. Leaders and managers will be armed with the data they need to understand where we are and where we need to go. And DEI will be institutionalized in every aspect of our business Ñ because itÕs foundational to our growth and culture and a holistic part of who we are. \\nDimensions of diversity and our uniqueness will only continue to evolve, and there will be more points of intersectionality as well. As a global company, we see endless opportunities to engage our people and think about talent and DEI more broadly, including connecting the conversation across regions to globalize how we think and act around issues, recognizing and celebrating intersectionality, creating solutions for socioeconomic diversity and driving opportunities to support underrepresented groups. \\nItÕs been a long and challenging road for DEI, but with the progress weÕve made and continue to make, IÕm hopeful and excited for our future. \\n\\n\\n\\nSOCIAL FINANCE\\nMaximizing  Social Impact   in Partnership    with Our Clients\\nÑ We often point to CitiÕs global footprint as our core differentiator  Ñ but this is  especially true when it comes to driving social impact.\\n\\nOver 15 years ago, in one of my early roles at Citi, I was introduced to Compartamos, a pioneering microfinance institution providing working capital loans to low-income women entrepreneurs in the south of Mexico. \\nThe company was expanding at a rapid pace, maintaining high levels of portfolio quality, and it became evident that it needed access to diverse sources of commercial capital to continue funding this growth and expand its outreach. After visiting CompartamosÕ operation to understand the business model, we opened their first account at Citi and quickly began to see the potential to help our new client support the needs of the local community at scale Ñ by connecting the company, and the women entrepreneurs they serve, to capital markets. \\nBack then, such initiatives to drive social impact through client transactions reaching the socalled Òlast mileÓ were in the early stages, and our approach was relatively simple, focusing on improving financial access. However, a lot of work had to be done to increase investor awareness in order to establish microfinance as a new asset class. \\nAt the time, the size and breadth of the challenges facing vulnerable communities in Mexico were enormous, with over 65% of the adult population still unbanked. I began to recognize how important it was to use the power of our business to develop scalable solutions, how much more we could be doing, and just how expansive a role an organization like Citi could play in increasing financial inclusion in developing markets by using a commercial approach. A global bank like Citi could help change the world for the better through its resources and product expertise, and maximizing these resources became the fundamental driving force of my work over the past 15-plus years. \\nOur work with Compartamos had a clear and increasing impact over the years: in 2007, Citi acted as bookrunner when Compartamos issued one of the microfinance industryÕs first IPOs. In 2011, it expanded to Guatemala and acquired a bank in Peru. In 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, Citi acted as the joint bookrunner for a local bond issuance, closing at $80 million, despite the uncertain economic environment. And just last year, we collaborated with development finance institutions in the United States and Japan to provide Compartamos with $70 million in financing to reach 135,000 small businesses Ñ 90% of which are women-owned. Throughout this period, Compartamos, now a full-fledged bank, went from a local finance company in Mexico serving 300,000 clients to a regional microfinance group serving 3 million. \\nThis is just one example of how Citi has collaborated with our clients and partners in local markets to scale their presence and impact. Over nearly two decades, we continued to evolve our work and expand access to financial services for individuals and communities that have historically been outside the reach of traditional financial institutions. Our initial focus on microfinance Ñ small dollar loans for individual entrepreneurs Ñ evolved into inclusive finance as we expanded the types of Citi clients and partners we work with to increase economic inclusion.  \\nFast-forward to 2021, which was a pivotal year: We announced the latest evolution of this work, building on our longstanding expertise and deepening our efforts to drive positive social impact. We broadened the scope of our work to help increase access to healthcare, education, housing, electricity, clean water, etc. Ñ basic necessities that help improve the livelihoods of low-income communities in emerging markets. We announced a new commitment, through which weÕre aiming to invest in opportunities for 15 million households, including 10 million women, globally by 2025. \\n\\nWe also published our new Citi Social Finance Framework and issued a first-of-its-kind $1 billion social finance bond, which supports CitiÕs broader  $1 trillion commitment to sustainable finance. \\nWhile the range of social issues we aim to address are complex, our mandate for Citi Social Finance is clear. We collaborate with clients and partners working in low-income communities, from microfinance organizations, local banks and fintech companies to local governments, multinational companies, investors and Development Finance Institutions. We then leverage our local expertise, balance sheets and access to global markets to mobilize capital. Our goal is to provide support to social enterprises and small businesses in these communities to accelerate and optimize their work, and to integrate social impact into our business model as a part of this process.\\nWe often point to CitiÕs global footprint as our core differentiator Ñ but this is especially true when it comes to driving social impact. One thing IÕve seen reinforced over the years is that our social finance efforts are inherently localized, and they can change fundamentally depending on the culture, history and population makeup of a market. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. This is where CitiÕs status as the worldÕs most global bank really comes in handy. Unlike other major banks, we have not only local currency capabilities, but also a true local presence with colleagues and networks on the ground to address specific needs. Over half of our global footprint is rooted in emerging markets. Our Social Finance specialist team works with Citi bankers on the ground who understand the local dynamics well and partner with us to develop and deliver innovative solutions. \\nWhile IÕm incredibly proud of the progress weÕve made, I continue to look forward. Advances in technology, data collection and analytics, and many other innovations will enable us to expand our efforts. IÕm more excited than ever for the future of social finance as we continue to deepen CitiÕs focus on embedding social impact in all  that we do.\t \\n\\n\\n\\nACTION FOR RACIAL EQUITY\\nFueling the  \\n Economic Engines    of Local \\n   Communities\\nBlack\tentrepreneurs\tand\tsmall\tbusiness\towners\tacross\tthe\tUnited\tStates\tcontinue\tto\tface\tsystemic\tinequities,\tmost\tnotably\taccess\tto\tcapital.\tEven\tbefore\tthe\tCOVID-19\tpandemic,\tBlack\tentrepreneurs\twere\tnearly\tthree\ttimes\tmore\tlikely\tthan\twhite\tentrepreneurs\tto\tsee\tnegative\timpacts\ton\tbusiness\tgrowth\tand\tprofitability\tdue\tto\ta\tlack\tof\taccess\tto\tfinancial\tcapital.\tStudies\talso\tshow\tBlack\tentrepreneurs\tapply\tfor\tbank\tloans\tless\tfrequently\tthan\twhite\tentrepreneurs\tÑ\tthey\tare\tabout\tthree\ttimes\tless\tlikely\tto\tapply\tfor\tcredit\twhen\tstarting\ta\tbusiness.\tMany\thesitate\tto\tapply\tfor\ta\tfundamental\treason:\tThey\tlack\taccess\tnot\tjust\tto\tcapital,\tbut\tto\tthe\tinformation\tcenters\tand\tfinancial\tnetworks\tthat\tconnect\tthem\tto\tthat\tcapital.\t\\n\\nQ&A\\nHAROLD BUTLER \\nManaging Director and Head of Diverse  \\nFinancial Institutions Group, Citi\\nJIM SILLS\\nPresident & CEO, M&F Bank\\n\\nIn September 2020, Citi and the Citi Foundation launched Action for Racial Equity, a $1.1 billion initiative to help close  the racial wealth gap in the United States. Citi has already invested $1 billion in strategic initiatives just one year into the three-year commitment, including $44 million in growth capital to support minority depository institutions (MDIs) Ñ trusted sources of banking and access to capital  for communities of color. \\nRecently, Citi created the Diverse Financial Institutions Group Ñ a dedicated team within Citi that will lead and expand firmwide engagement with MDIs, diverse broker-dealers and diverse asset managers. This will enable Citi to provide equity, where possible, promote growth through deal opportunities and inclusion, and engage in capacity building Ñ all of which will help reduce the racial wealth gap by strengthening the financial institutions that know the communities best.\\nHarold Butler, managing director and head of CitiÕs Diverse Financial Institutions Group, and Jim Sills, president and CEO of M&F Bank, a Black-owned bank servicing communities in North Carolina and one of CitiÕs first MDI partners, discuss the importance of providing equitable access to capital to communities of color, including Black entrepreneurs and businesses, and how financial institutions like Citi can help. \\nQ: What led you to do this  \\nkind of work? \\nSills: Earlier in my career, when I was working at a national bank in Delaware, the African American CEO tapped me on my shoulder and said, ÒI want you to help me buy a minorityowned bank.Ó At that time, I did not know that individuals could acquire financial institutions. During the Savings & Loans crisis, we purchased an MDI founded in 1894 by Booker T. Washington from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It was one of the best work experiences in my career. Given the size of the community, we could see the tangible difference we were making when providing access to capital to purchase homes and cars and expand businesses. I am pleased to report that I get the same feeling working at M&F, which is the second-oldest minority-owned bank in the country.\\nQ: Describe CitiÕs work with MDIs,  including the newly launched Diverse Financial Institutions Group.\\nButler: Our work with MDIs is not new. We have a history of intentional focus and prioritization on strengthening the economic growth of MDIs. For example, in 2016, Citi piloted the Citi¨ ATM Community Network Ñ a program that enables clients of participating MDIs, community banks and credit unions to access Citibank ATMs free of charge. One year later, the U.S. Department of the Treasury worked closely with Citi to develop and pilot their Financial Agent Mentor-Protg Program. This program pairs large financial institutions with MDIs, with the goal of expanding TreasuryÕs Financial Agent Selection Process, as well as helping interested MDIs become Financial Agent Banks able to perform and win U.S. Department of the Treasury contracts as prime contractors  or subcontractors. \\nYet, we knew more was needed. During 2020, in the midst of the global pandemic and the spotlight on racial injustices in the United States, we asked ourselves, ÒWhat more can we do? How can we make a meaningful impact in underrepresented communities by helping improve the way people live and what they have access to?Ó That began with deepening our investments in MDIs through Action for Racial Equity to provide MDIs with more access to capital and the broader spectrum of Citi resources. Racial equity funds and loan commitments are a good first step, but to solve the nuanced problem of racial wealth disparity, large banks, like Citi, need to do more to democratize the myriad processes involved in enabling access.\\nWith the creation of our Diverse Financial Institutions Group, it will help us institutionalize our work with diverse financial institutions and embed racial equity across our firm, enabling us to better support the communities we serve.\\nQ: What were some of M&F BankÕs needs when Citi first approached your team  on partnership opportunities? \\nSills: We were in need of capital to continue to serve underserved communities in North Carolina. Without capital, it is very difficult to grow and expand. Capital is king! So, our relationship with Citi started with an equity investment in 2021. Then it blossomed quickly into lending opportunities, Bridge built by CitiSM, technical assistance for our bank, and of course the connection to the Mentor-Protg Program. The work of the Diverse Financial Institutions Group collectively serves as an excellent partner.\\nQ: This work involves fairly complex  financial tools and processes, but  ultimately, whatÕs the impact it has on  someoneÕs life and the community in  which one lives?  \\nSills: Over our 115-year history, M&F has provided financing to thousands of customers across North Carolina, totaling over $1.5 billion. I have a current tangible example. As a result of the Citi equity investment, M&F was able to participate in PPP (the Small Business AdministrationÕs Paycheck Protection Program). In 2021, we provided PPP loan funding for 630 businesses totaling $35 million in 81 different markets across North Carolina. Further, weÕve also been able to attract new businesses and customers, which has increased our assets from $265 million to $370 million over the past 20 months. The bottom line is that CitiÕs work with MDIs makes the banking sector a better sector. Collectively, we can help way more people. ThatÕs good for the economy, good for people of color and good for the industry.\\nQ: WhatÕs the benefit of collaborating  \\ntogether across so many different  \\nareas Ñ including equity investments, lending opportunities and the Mentor-Protg  Program?\\nSills: The key words are exposure and access. Small banks like ours are little economic engines for our communities, but we can only focus on a few things at a time. Partnering with banks like Citi exposes us to opportunities, partners and support. All that builds our growth potential and our sustainability. WeÕre empowered and enabled, so when opportunities present themselves, weÕll be ready; we can  take off and go. \\nButler: The power of banks like M&F comes from their locality Ñ they know the local residents well, can reach people and build relationships on a deeper level. What we are doing helps them carry out the mission and provide lending products and other programs like financial education that can make a true difference in the greater community. \\nAt the end of the day, itÕs about supporting communities. WeÕve consulted with other big banks and have shared best practices about what weÕre doing in this space. We need all banks to have initiatives like this Ñ thatÕs how we can help close the racial wealth gap.\t\\n\\n\\n2021 ESG Executive Summary\\n\\n2021 ESG Executive Summary\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n2021 ESG Executive Summary\\n\\n2021 ESG Executive Summary\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n2021 ESG Executive Summary\\n\\n2021 ESG Executive Summary\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n2021 ESG Executive Summary\\n\\n2021 ESG Executive Summary\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n2021 ESG Executive Summary\\n\\n2021 ESG Executive Summary\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n', 'curated', '', 'esg', 'admin')\n",

We are integrating technology and expertiseÑfrom IBM, our partners, and even our competitorsÑ to meet the urgent needs of our clients, who see hybrid cloud and AI as crucial sources of competitive advantage. And we are ready to be the catalyst of progress for our clients as they pursue the digital transformation of the worldÕs mission-critical businesses.  \tAs you will see in this report, our strategy is resonating with clients and partners, our technology and business expertise are  in high demand, and our company is more nimble, focused, and positioned for sustainable growth.\\n2021 performance\\nFor the year, IBM generated $57.4 billion in revenue and  $12.8 billion in cash from operations.\\n \tRevenue growth accelerated at constant currency throughout 2021, and we exited the year with 8.6% growth in the fourth quarter, including approximately 3.5 points from incremental external sales to Kyndryl. Hybrid cloud revenue grew 19%  at constant currency in 2021 and now makes up 35% of IBM revenue. Today, over 70% of our annual revenue is in software and consulting, both delivering healthy, sustainable growth.  \tOur performance was driven by our unique ability to combine IBMÕs technology and expertise to create value for our clients  and partners. We integrate IBM Software, IBM Consulting, and IBM Infrastructure to deliver this value.\\n \tIBM Software allows clients to leverage the full power of hybrid cloud and AI. Software revenues were up 4% at constant currency. Red Hat continues to gain momentum, growing nearly 21% at constant currency in the fourth quarter, benefiting from its integration with IBMÕs portfolio and reflecting strong demand for open source innovation. \\n \tIBM Consulting revenues were up 8% at constant currency, driven by clients that rely on IBM as their trusted partner for digital transformation. \\n \tIBM Infrastructure revenues declined 3% at constant currency, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Clients continue  to leverage our Power servers, storage, and IBM Z systems as foundational elements of their hybrid cloud infrastructure. In  fact, we have shipped more MIPs in the z15 than any program  in our history.\\n\\n2 \\n \tWith this revenue and cash generation, we returned  $6 billion to stockholders through dividends in 2021. We reduced debt by $10 billion in 2021 and by $21 billion since acquiring  Red Hat in 2019. We did all of this while we continued to invest  in skills, innovation, and our ecosystem, including $3 billion  on acquisitions in the year.\\n \tIBM now has a higher-growth, higher-value business, with strong and growing free cash flow, lower capital intensity, and attractive shareholder returns.\\nStrategy and execution\\nWe entered 2021 with a series of clear but ambitious goals:  to strengthen our portfolio, simplify our operations, and broaden our ecosystem. Our financial performance is a direct reflection  of our ability to execute against these goals.  \tThroughout the year, we continued to align our offerings  with the two most transformational technologies of our time: hybrid cloud and AI. Our platform-centric approach starts with Red Hat, which allows our clients to develop and deploy their applications on private and public clouds, achieve consistent security across their computing infrastructure, and consume innovation from anywhere. \\n \tOur portfolio is positioned to capture the $1 trillion hybrid cloud opportunity, enabling our clients to access and deploy our AI capabilities on IBMÕs cloud or those of other major providers. Our software has been enhanced and bundled to help clients become more data-driven, and to automate, secure, and modernize their business and IT operations. IBM Consulting  has transformed itself by deepening its technical expertise  and embracing a co-creation model with clients.  \tTo complement our organic investments, we made 15 strategic acquisitions to strengthen and extend our hybrid cloud and AI offerings. For example, Waeg, Bluetab, and Taos reinforce our cloud consulting expertise. Turbonomic integrates with Instana and Watson AIOps to create an industry-leading suite of automation software. The recent acquisition of Envizi builds on our existing asset management and supply chain solutions to help organizations develop more resilient and sustainable operations. And ReaQta expands our AI-based threat detection and response capabilities in IBM Security. \\n \tTo improve how we deliver the value of these offerings to  our clients, we have updated our client engagement model to emphasize experiential selling and co-creation. We have also greatly expanded our partner ecosystem. This network of systems integrators, independent software vendors, service providers, channel partners, and developers has been carefully selected  to deliver value to our clients, our partners, and IBM. In 2021,  we strengthened existing relationships with companies like Adobe, Oracle, and EY. We created new consulting services  in collaboration with SAP and co-created an AI-enabled  analytics solution with Deloitte. We announced new strategic partnerships with Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, and Telus, all focused on 5G, Edge, and network automation. And we saw  our partnership revenue with AWS, Azure, and Salesforce  grow more than 50%.\\nA client-centric culture \\nOur efforts have been designed to accelerate the delivery of value to our clients and partners, part of a larger cultural shift at IBM toward total client-centricity. We believe that IBM has a unique ability to solve our clientsÕ most pressing business problems, bringing together all the necessary hardware, software, and consulting, regardless of whether those solutions come from  IBM or our ecosystem partners. \\n \tWe are seeing high demand for our capabilities in many areas. Clients want to automate as many business tasks as possible given the current workforce dynamics. They are increasingly using AI and predictive capabilities to improve their supply chains. Security remains a major focus area, as the cost of cybercrime continues to rise. As clients deal with these challenges and opportunities, they are looking for a trusted partner with a  proven track record of delivering strategic transformation.  \tFor example, we are helping SpainÕs Telefnica to modernize its network platform, combining the potential of 5G with the customization and intelligence of hybrid cloud. National Grid,  a leading US electric and gas utility, is working with IBM  and Boston Dynamics to analyze data at the edge in real time  to improve equipment uptime and prevent power outages.  The Australian federal government is working with IBM on  the technology platform that powers the countryÕs COVID-19 vaccination program. And IBM Consulting and PNC Bank partnered on a next-generation solution that allows customers  to make banking decisions based on real-time dataÑa massive change for the banking industry. \\n \tThis client-first, problem-solving approach is the reason why our client renewal rates are increasing and our recurring revenue base is growing. It is the reason why longtime clients like CVS, Verizon, and Anthem continue to put their trust in our people and our technology. And it is the reason why we now have more than 3,800 hybrid cloud platform clients and nearly 3,000 clients co-creating in IBM Garages.\\n\\n3\\nOur commitment to science and innovation\\nWhile we are focused on meeting the needs of clients today,  we continue to shape the technologies of tomorrow. That is why IBM Research continues to advance the fundamental science  of computing, driving innovation and pioneering a new era of accelerated discovery. \\n \tIBM continues to lead the development of quantum computing. This year, we delivered operational quantum computers to Japan and Germany, deployed the worldÕs first 127-qubit processor, and are now on our way to a 1,000-qubit processor by the end of 2023. We also forged a series of longterm partnerships with universities, governments, and hospitals to develop quantum applications that will accelerate the discovery of everything from medicine to materials. \\n \tIn 2021, we unveiled not one, but two, major breakthroughs in semiconductor design. First, the worldÕs first 2-nanometer  chip technology, which will allow 50 billion transistors to fit on  a chip the size of a fingernail. The chips are expected to achieve  45% higher performance than todayÕs 7-nanometer chips. Second, in collaboration with our Albany Research Alliance partner Samsung, IBM Research introduced a completely new approach to semiconductor design called Vertical-Transport Nanosheet Field Effect Transistor, or VTFET, which could help keep MooreÕs law alive for years to come.\\nResponsible stewardship for the digital age\\nAt IBM, we have always understood that our responsibilities extend far beyond the bottom line. That is why we embrace  \\nour leadership role in defining good tech in the digital age.\tArvind Krishna  \tAmong the most pressing challenges facing our society  \tChairman and  \\ntoday is closing the STEM skills gap, which holds back both \tChief Executive Officer technological and socioeconomic progress. To address this  issue, IBM regularly engages at the highest levels of government to improve access to the education and skills needed for  modern, rewarding jobs. In addition, IBM has committed  to providing 30 million people of all ages with critical skills by  2030, by fostering more than 50 new partnerships for the  IBM SkillsBuild program.\\n \tWe also continue to make progress on diversity and inclusion, which we believe is imperative for the health of our business  and our society. In 2021, we added a diversity modifier to our executive compensation program to reinforce the importance  of a diverse workplace. The Human Rights Campaign Foundation designated IBM as a ÒBest Place to Work for LGBTQ+ EqualityÓ with a 100% rating. These effortsÑand othersÑwere recently recognized by JUST Capital, which named IBM the most just company in our industry. \\n4 \\n \tIn 2021, we furthered our tradition of leadership in sustainability, announcing a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 across all the countries in which we operate. Our commitment to the environment is also evident in our products, including the new IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, which combines weather, climate, and operational data to measure and manage environmental performance. And in May, IBM launched the 2021 Call for Code Global Challenge, which invited the worldÕs software developers to combat climate change with technology powered by open source software. The top prize this year went to Saaf Water, an accessible water quality sensor and analytics platform for people living in rural localities.\\nThe catalyst that makes the world work better\\nOn the cover of this report is a simple phrase: ÒLetÕs create.Ó  This is a signal to the world that IBM has changed. We are  more open to partnership, more open to ideas, and more open  to innovation than ever before. ÒLetÕs createÓ is an invitation to  all of our stakeholders to join us in solving the most complex problems facing business and society today. \\n \tAs the nature of those problems changes over time, so too  will IBM, reinventing itself to overcome whatever obstacles stand in the way of progress. And while many things about our company change, there are some things that will always stay the same.  We will always be dedicated to our clientsÕ success, pursue innovation that matters, and set the standard for trust and responsibility. \\n \tWhy do we hold ourselves to such high standards? Because IBMÕs clients own and operate the planetÕs mission-critical systems: electrical grids, airlines, telecommunications networks, banks, government services, and many others. These systems  are more than just engines of economic growth. They are the systems that support modern society. In making them faster, more productive, and more secure, we donÕt just make business work better; we make the world work better. We donÕt just  create business value; we create progress. \\n \tI believe IBM is now positioned to be the catalyst of that progress for decades to come.\\n\\nArvind Krishna \\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nIn an effort to provide additional and useful information regarding the companyÕs financial results and other financial information, as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), these materials contain non-GAAP financial measures  on a continuing operations basis, including revenue growth rates adjusted for constant currency.

This Overview is designed to provide the reader with some perspective regarding the information contained in the financial section. \\nOrganization of Information \\n¥ The Management Discussion is designed to provide readers with an overview of the business and a narrative on our financial results and certain factors that may affect our future prospects from the perspective of management. The ÒManagement Discussion SnapshotÓ presents an overview of the key performance drivers in 2021. \\n¥ On November 3, 2021, the company completed the previously announced separation of its managed infrastructure services unit into a new public company with the distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. (Kyndryl) to IBM stockholders on a pro rata basis. To effect the separation, IBM stockholders received one share of Kyndryl common stock for every five shares of IBM common stock held at the close of business on October 25, 2021, the record date for the distribution. The company retained 19.9 percent of the shares of Kyndryl common stock immediately following the separation with the intent to dispose of such shares within twelve months after the distribution. The company accounts for the retained Kyndryl common stock as a fair value investment included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with subsequent fair value changes included in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement.  \\n¥ The accounting requirements for reporting the separation of Kyndryl as a discontinued operation were met when the separation was completed. Accordingly, the historical results of Kyndryl are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Refer to note C, ÒSeparation of Kyndryl,Ó for additional information. \\n¥ Beginning with the ÒYear in Review,Ó the Management Discussion contains the results of operations for each reportable segment of the business, a discussion of our financial position recast to reflect the separation of Kyndryl and a discussion of cash flows as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Other key sections within the Management Discussion include: ÒLooking ForwardÓ and ÒLiquidity and Capital Resources,Ó the latter of which includes a description of managementÕs definition and use of free cash flow. \\n¥ The Consolidated Financial Statements provide an overview of income and cash flow performance and financial position. \\n¥ The Notes follow the Consolidated Financial Statements. Among other items, the Notes contain our accounting policies, information on the separation of Kyndryl, revenue information, acquisitions and divestitures, certain commitments and contingencies and retirement-related plans information. \\n¥ Effective immediately prior to the separation of Kyndryl, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system. These changes impacted the companyÕs reportable segments beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 but did not impact the companyÕs Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to note E, ÒSegments,Ó for additional information on the companyÕs reportable segments. The segments presented in this Annual Report are reported on a comparable basis for all periods. \\n¥ On July 9, 2019, IBM acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Red Hat, Inc. (Red Hat). Red Hat is reported within the Software segment, in Hybrid Platform & Solutions. Refer to note F, ÒAcquisitions & Divestitures,Ó for additional information. \\n¥ The references to Òadjusted for currencyÓ or Òat constant currencyÓ in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. When we refer to growth rates at constant currency or adjust such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior-year periodÕs currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. See ÒCurrency Rate FluctuationsÓ for additional information. \\n¥ To provide useful decision-making information for management and shareholders, the company defines and measures hybrid cloud revenue as end-to-end cloud capabilities within hybrid cloud environments, which includes technology (software and hardware), services and solutions to enable clients to implement cloud solutions across public, private and multi-clouds. The definition of hybrid cloud revenue is consistent with the prior methodology for cloud revenue historically presented. This spans across IBMÕs Consulting, Software and Infrastructure segments. Examples include (but are not limited to) Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Red Hat OpenShift, Cloud Paks, as-a-service offerings, service engagements related to cloud deployment of technology and applications, and infrastructure used in cloud deployments. \\n¥ Within the financial statements and tables in this Annual Report, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages reported are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar numbers. \\nOperating (non-GAAP) Earnings  \\nIn an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the business, supplementally, management separates business results into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, intangible asset amortization, expense resulting from basis differences on equity method investments, retirement-related costs, certain impacts from the Kyndryl separation and related tax effects. Due to the unique, non-recurring nature of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform), management characterizes the one-time provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjustments to that charge as non-operating. Adjustments include true-ups, accounting elections and any changes to regulations, laws, audit adjustments, etc. that affect the recorded one-time charge. Management also characterizes direct and incremental charges incurred related to the Kyndryl separation as non-operating given their unique and non-recurring nature. These charges include applicable employee awards and tax impacts related to the separation. Given its unique and temporary nature, management has also characterized the unrealized gain on Kyndryl common stock recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement as non-operating. The gain reflects fair value changes in the shares that were retained by the company immediately following the separation, with the intent to dispose of such shares within twelve months after the distribution. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable retention, restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of the companyÕs acquisitions. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. Throughout the Management Discussion, the impact of acquisitions over the prior 12-month period may be a driver of higher expense year to year. For retirement-related costs, management characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. We include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service costs, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service costs, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and the company considers these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business. \\nOverall, management believes that supplementally providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the companyÕs pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. In addition, these non-GAAP measures provide a perspective consistent with areas of interest we routinely receive from investors and analysts. Our reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with our management and measurement system. \\nFORWARD-LOOKING AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS \\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

NMÐNot meaningful \\nSeparation of Kyndryl \\nOn November 3, 2021, IBM took an important step in advancing its focus on hybrid cloud and Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the separation of its managed infrastructure services unit into a new public company, Kyndryl. The separation of Kyndryl creates two industry-leading companies, which will continue to have a strong commercial relationship. Both IBM and Kyndryl have increased clarity and ability to focus on their respective operating and financial models, including capital deployment, investment strategies, and investment grade capital structures. The separation enables greater freedom of action to partner and capture new opportunities. The outcome of all of these actions will be increased value for clients and investors. \\nGlobal Pandemic \\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic which resulted in significant governmental measures being initiated around the globe to slow down and control the spread of the virus. As we managed through the second year of the pandemic, the health of IBM employees, our clients, business partners and community remains our primary focus. We are actively engaged to ensure our plans continue to be aligned with recommendations of the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and governmental regulations.   \\nThe continued environment of uncertainty has only reinforced the need for clients to modernize their businesses to succeed in this new normal, with hybrid cloud and AI at the core of their digital transformations. Across industries, clients are using technology as a source of competitive advantage. We are enabling clientsÕ transformations by embedding technology at the core of their businesses. Among other things, for example, we are leveraging our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities to help clients reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. We are also applying data analytics and automation to mitigate friction in their supply chains and automate business tasks. \\nThe spending environment continued to improve throughout the year despite additional waves of the pandemic. From an industry standpoint, we have seen meaningful improvement in areas most affected by the pandemic such as travel, transportation, automotive and industrial products as well as retail and consumer packaged goods. IBM continues to be well positioned to support our clients to emerge even stronger. \\nFinancial Performance Summary \\nIn 2021, we reported $57.4 billion in revenue, income from continuing operations of $4.7 billion and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $7.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $5.21 as reported and $7.93 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. On a consolidated basis, we generated $12.8 billion in cash from operations and $6.5 billion in free cash flow, which includes 10 months of Kyndryl operations, cash impacts from the structural actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and Kyndryl separation-related charges, and delivered shareholder returns of $5.9 billion in dividends. These results reflect progress in our key growth areas resulting from the strong client demand we see in the marketplace for our technology and consulting. We continue to increase investments in skills, innovation and our ecosystem, and our balance sheet continues to provide us with the flexibility to support our business needs. \\nTotal revenue grew 3.9 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year with increases in our key growth areas of software and consulting. Year-to-year performance also included a benefit from incremental revenue from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, which represented approximately 1 point of our fullyear revenue growth. Software revenue increased 5.3 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency, including approximately 2 points of growth from fourth-quarter sales to Kyndryl. Hybrid Platform & Solutions grew 8.8 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency), led by strong double-digit growth in Red Hat. Transaction Processing declined 3.3 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) as clients continued their preference for operating expenses over capital expenditures. Consulting revenue increased 9.8 percent as reported and 8 percent adjusted for currency with growth across all three business areas. Infrastructure revenue decreased 2.4 percent year to year as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency, with the overall decline in revenue reflecting our product cycle dynamics. This performance also includes approximately 1 point of growth from fourth-quarter sales to Kyndryl. Across the segments, total hybrid cloud revenue of $20.2 billion in 2021 grew 20 percent as reported and 19 percent adjusted for currency. \\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas revenue grew 4.4 percent year to year as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency). Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) increased 4.1 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific grew 2.8 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency).  \\nThe gross margin of 54.9 percent decreased 1.0 point year to year, however, gross profit dollars increased 2.0 percent compared to the prior year. Overall, gross margin was impacted by the significant investments we are making to drive our hybrid cloud and AI strategy as well as our product cycle dynamics. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 56.2 percent decreased 1.1 points versus the prior year.  \\nTotal expense and other (income) decreased 5.8 percent in 2021 versus the prior year primarily driven by a $1.9 billion (7 points) decrease in charges for workforce rebalancing and a benefit from expected credit loss expense in the current year compared to a provision in the prior year, partially offset by higher non-operating retirement-related costs and the effects of currency. Our expense dynamics reflect a higher level of investment in innovation, skills and our ecosystem, both organically and through acquisitions, as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We are aggressively hiring and scaling resources to better serve clients, while increasing our research spend to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas such as quantum and we are expanding our ecosystem. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 6.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs.  \\nPre-tax income from continuing operations of $4.8 billion increased 88.0 percent and the pre-tax margin was 8.4 percent, an increase of 3.8 points versus 2020, primarily due to the higher workforce rebalancing charges in 2020. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2021 was 2.6 percent compared to (52.9) percent in 2020. The current-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by tax benefits related to audit settlements in multiple jurisdictions. The prior-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion related to an intra-entity sale of certain of the companyÕs intellectual property (IP) in the first quarter of 2020, and a benefit of $0.2 billion related to a foreign tax law change. Net income from continuing operations of $4.7 billion increased 19.8 percent and the net income from continuing operations margin was 8.2 percent, up 1.1 points year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $7.9 billion increased 43.6 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations increased 3.8 points to 13.7 percent, reflecting the lower workforce rebalancing charges in the current year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2021 was 9.0 percent compared to (11.5) percent in 2020. The prior year operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was primarily driven by the net tax benefit from the intra-entity IP sale. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $7.2 billion increased 17.2 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 12.5 percent was up 1.4 points year to year.  \\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.21 in 2021 increased 18.9 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $7.93 increased 16.3 percent versus 2020, with the prior year including a ($1.33) impact from the fourth-quarter structural actions on both an as reported and operating (non-GAAP) basis. \\nOur balance sheet is presented on a consolidated basis, with the December 31, 2020 balance sheet reclassified to provide line items on a continuing operations basis and separately provide current and noncurrent assets and liabilities for Kyndryl discontinued operations. In order to present a meaningful year-to-year comparison, the amounts presented below exclude assets and liabilities of discontinued operations. \\nAt December 31, 2021, the balance sheet remained strong with the flexibility to support and invest in the business needs. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities at year end were $7.6 billion, a decrease of $6.7 billion from December 31, 2020. During 2021, we continued to de-lever our debt, invest in acquisitions and provide a growing dividend to shareholders. We have reduced total debt by $9.6 billion from prior year end and $21.3 billion since the second quarter of 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat transaction). \\nTotal assets, excluding discontinued operations, decreased $8.2 billion (decreased $5.1 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by: \\n¥ A decrease of $6.7 billion ($6.5 billion adjusted for currency) in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities due to debt paydown, investments in acquisitions and dividend payments; \\n¥ A decline in receivables of $3.5 billion ($2.8 billion adjusted for currency) primarily due to sales of financing receivables and volumes decline; and \\n¥ A decrease in deferred taxes of $1.0 billion ($0.7 billion adjusted for currency) primarily due to pension plan remeasurements, foreign audit settlements and realization of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions; partially offset by \\n¥ An increase in prepaid pension assets of $2.3 billion ($2.4 billion adjusted for currency) driven by plan remeasurements and higher returns on plan assets; and \\n¥ An increase of $1.4 billion ($1.5 billion adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to our investment in Kyndryl and an increase in derivative assets.  \\nTotal liabilities, excluding discontinued operations, decreased $15.1 billion (decreased $10.9 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by: \\n¥ A decrease in total debt of $9.6 billion ($8.4 billion adjusted for currency) primarily driven by debt maturities and early retirements; \\n¥ A decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations of $2.7 billion ($1.9 billion adjusted for currency) mainly driven by plan remeasurements; and \\n¥ A decrease in other accrued expenses and liabilities of $1.7 billion ($1.2 billion adjusted for currency) primarily due to payments for workforce rebalancing actions. \\nTotal equity of $19.0 billion decreased $1.7 billion from December 31, 2020 as a result of: \\n¥ A decrease of $7.2 billion related to the separation of Kyndryl; and \\n¥ Dividends paid of $5.9 billion; partially offset by \\n¥ Net income of $5.7 billion; and \\n¥ A decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $4.8 billion. \\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, include the cash flows of discontinued operations. For 2021, they included 10 months of Kyndryl operations versus a full year of Kyndryl in 2020. \\nOn a consolidated basis, cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 billion in 2021, a decrease of $5.4 billion compared to 2020, driven primarily by a decrease in cash provided by receivables ($3.9 billion) and a decrease in payroll tax and value-added tax payment liabilities ($1.0 billion) due to payments in the current year for tax relief provided under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs in 2020.  \\nNet cash used in investing activities of $6.0 billion increased $2.9 billion compared to the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in net cash used for acquisitions ($3.0 billion).  \\nFinancing activities were a net use of cash of $13.4 billion in 2021 compared to $9.7 billion in 2020. The year-to-year increase of $3.6 billion was driven by a decrease in net cash provided from debt transactions ($4.4 billion), partially offset by an increase in cash provided of $0.9 billion due to the Kyndryl distribution to IBM at separation. \\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS \\nPlease refer to IBMÕs Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2022, for Item 1A. entitled ÒRisk Factors.Ó \\nIBM is addressing the hybrid cloud and AI opportunity with a platform-centric approach, focused on providing two primary sources of client value Ð technology and business expertise. We provide integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology and services capabilities support clientsÕ digital transformations and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of capabilities in software, consulting services, and a deep incumbency in mission-critical systems, all bolstered by one of the worldÕs leading research organizations. \\nIBM Strategy \\nOur strategy is focused on helping clients leverage the power of hybrid cloud and Artificial Intelligence (AI). In 2021, we took an important step with the spin-off of our managed infrastructure services business, now known as Kyndryl. Our strategy resonates with clients, who must continually innovate and redefine their businesses with technology. Our flexible, secure, and open hybrid cloud platform accelerates clientsÕ outcomes, differentiates the company, and drives a multiplier effect across our software, consulting, and infrastructure businesses as well as to a broad ecosystem of partners. Our strategy positions IBM for accelerated growth today, while preparing the company for the opportunities of the future.  \\nAccelerating Digital Transformation  \\nA new era of rapid change and disruption is underway. The need for digital transformation has dramatically accelerated due to the pandemic and extends through the core mission-critical business processes of almost all large enterprises. Successful digital transformations face major obstacles: (1) managing increased complexity, as large enterprises use multiple heterogeneous IT environments and clouds, (2) deriving value from an explosion of available data, projected by analysts to grow up to three-fold in the next three years, (3) guaranteeing competitive operations, in the context of disruptive changes and worker shortages, (4) addressing  the increase of malicious security breaches and rising cost of cybercrime, and (5) successfully meeting those challenges together with a cohesive end-to-end sustainable execution.   \\nTo address these obstacles, enterprises want technology that provides flexibility with open-source across heterogeneous environments Ð an approach known as hybrid cloud. We have demonstrated that such an approach creates 2.5 times more value for enterprises than a public cloud-only one. Open-source technologies, such as Linux, containers, and Kubernetes, are essential to hybrid cloud, as they harness the power of millions of developers to accelerate the speed of innovation. 85 percent of organizations expect to use Linux containers by 2025. Additionally, AI continues to expand as a key technology to unlock value, with more than 80 percent of enterprises agreeing that intelligent automation can improve business results. As AI for production scales, enterprises and governments focus on ensuring AI models are unbiased and trustworthy.    \\nA Differentiated Architecture for Business Innovation \\nThe evolution we see in the market confirms the strategic changes executed by IBM to deliver on a hybrid cloud and AI strategy, creating sustained value for our clients. Our differentiation derives from a flexible, secure, open hybrid cloud platform, the comprehensive set of assets it impacts, and our ability to combine them to scale up solutions for enterprise digital transformation and mission-critical systems.  \\nOur value proposition builds on five core capabilities, addressing our clientsÕ hybrid cloud and AI needs: (1) Build and modernize for the hybrid cloud, to develop and operate with speed, consistency and agility, (2) Create data-driven business insights regardless of where data lives and while maintaining enterprise grade data governance, privacy and trust, (3) Automate the end-to-end enterprise processes, for effectiveness and efficiency with AI driven decision-making, (4) Secure everywhere, with consistent governance and compliance across environments, and (5) Bring it together by transforming our clientsÕ businesses and processes into sustainable bestin-class industry practices.  \\nOur full technology stack helps us to meet clients wherever they are in digital transformation, and we offer the consulting expertise to help guide and implement the best solutions for that journey. Our rapidly growing ecosystem of cloud, ISVs, hardware, network, and services partners enhance the client experience and drive the value and innovation that can be derived from IBM open-source technologies. \\n\\nIBM Consulting\\n\\nBusiness Transformation ¥ \\nTechnology Consulting ¥\\nApplication Operations\\n\\n\\nSystem Integrator Partners\\n\\n\\n\\nIBM Software\\nIBM Cloud Paks\\n\\nAutomation ¥ Data & AI ¥ \\nSecurity ¥ Transaction Processing\\n\\n\\nSoftware and SaaS Partners\\n\\n\\nRed Hat Hybrid Cloud Platform\\n\\nDevelopment, Security and Operational Services\\n\\nOpenShift ¥ Red Hat Enterprise Linux ¥ Ansible Automation Platform\\n \\nOur hybrid cloud approach is platform-centric, with Linux, containers, and Kubernetes as the architectural foundation. Platforms provide compelling economics:  every $1 of platform spend on average drives $3 to $5 of software revenue, $6 to $8 of services and $1 to $2 of enterprise infrastructure. The multiplier effect of our technology stack creates more value for IBM and our growing ecosystem of partners. The hybrid cloud market alone represents a $1 trillion market, out of which (1) Red Hat Hybrid cloud platforms and IBM Software address a $450 billion market opportunity, (2) IBM Consulting, a $300 billion market opportunity, and (3) IBM Infrastructure, a $230 billion market opportunity. \\nTo capture this hybrid cloud market opportunity, we are prioritizing our investment in offerings aligned to our stated strategy such as Red Hat OpenShift and RHEL, IBM Cloud Paks, related IBM Consulting practices and IBM Infrastructure. We have purposefully embedded our hybrid cloud open platform with our other offerings, to accelerate innovation and amplify impact in our clientsÕ environment. We have also fostered our ESG initiatives, as the world continues to move toward a more circular economy, a priority for our stakeholder groups and a growing business opportunity for IBM. In 2021, we targeted 2030 for reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions, and we launched new AI-enabled solutions such as the IBM Environmental Intelligent Suite, to make our clients more sustainable over time.  \\nIn addition to our organic investments in R&D, we have been aggressive in inorganic investments in critical hybrid cloud and sustainability software assets, such as Instana, Turbonomic and Envizi. In Consulting, we have also been aggressive acquiring the expertise our clients demand to support their digital innovation including 7Summits, Taos, BoxBoat Technologies and BlueTab Solutions. We successfully completed 15 acquisitions in 2021.  \\nIBM Software solutions amplify the growth and value of our hybrid cloud platform into the software stack with four critical technology capabilities Ð (1) ÒModernizeÓ from legacy to hybrid cloud architecture, (2) Create Òdata-drivenÓ business insights from distributed data linked via a hybrid data fabric powered by an automated governance, (3) ÒAutomateÓ end-to-end processes running across IT and business environments, (4) ÒSecureÓ together multiple environments, applications and data. Our capabilities are delivered through Cloud Paks that are pre-integrated, pre-certified, AI-powered containerized software packages and are optimized for Red Hat OpenShift. Of the Fortune 500, 40 percent have purchased IBM Cloud Paks, and two-thirds use IBM Security, while increasingly leveraging our expanding software subscription and as-a-service models. We deeply infuse Artificial Intelligence across our Software portfolio, and we are advancing trustworthy AI with a multidisciplinary approach through the IBM AI Ethics board. In 2021, we added new natural language processing enhancements to Watson Discovery. We are combining and integrating products such as Turbonomic, Instana and Watson AIOps to offer a complete set of AI-powered automation software. \\nRed Hat, reported in our Software segment, is the leading hybrid cloud software platform, and the only one that is fully integrated and open source, with built-in development, security, and operations features. More than 94 percent of the Fortune 500 use Red Hat products and solutions. Red Hat takes advantage of a broad ecosystem of partners and of millions of developers to accelerate innovation. Leveraging the power of Kubernetes and containers, OpenShift creates the foundation that allows our clients to manage siloed, multi-cloud, edge, and legacy infrastructure as a single platform. These capabilities are a clear differentiator, enabling our clients to Òwrite once, deploy anywhereÓ for their hybrid architecture. We are seeing strong momentum, with more than 3,800 clients using our hybrid cloud platform, adding 1,000 clients in 2021. Red Hat OpenShift is recognized as a leader and clear choice for container platform, with more than 40 percent market share in 2021. We are continually investing in Red Hat OpenShift, RHEL and Ansible to extend our technology leadership, while combining the Red Hat platform with IBMÕs incumbency, scale, and reach.  \\nIBM Consulting, with 150,000+ professionals in over 150+ countries, helps clients design their digital transformation, build open hybrid cloud architectures, orchestrate applications across environments, and optimize key workflows and business processes. 100 percent of top ten companies in financial services, telecoms, public sector, automotive and healthcare are clients. IBM Consulting has more Red Hat OpenShift certified experts than any of our competition and drove about 700 Red Hat engagements in 2021. IBM Consulting has re-designed its services practices to foster adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and has built or migrated hybrid cloud applications for more than 500 clients. IBM Consulting works with our hybrid cloud and AI ecosystem partners and developers to create the custom solutions that realize digital transformation for clients worldwide, across industries. IBM Consulting also captures growth by investing in advanced practices with AWS, Azure, and major ISVs, such as Adobe, Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.  \\nIBM Infrastructure is the foundation of our hybrid cloud stack, and closely integrates the Red Hat solutions. Our clients are using a combination of public and private cloud infrastructure to keep their mission-critical data and workloads secure, and we continue to be at the heart of mission-critical enterprise workloads. For example, 90 percent of the top 50 banks run on IBM Z, our Mainframe solution.

The financing arrangements are predominantly for products or services that are critical to the end usersÕ business operations and support IBMÕs hybrid cloud platform and AI strategy. Financing conducts a comprehensive credit evaluation of its clients prior to extending financing. As a captive financier, Financing has the benefit of both deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services financed. These factors allow the business to effectively manage two of the major risks associated with financing, credit and residual value, while generating strong returns on equity. \\nFinancing comprises the following two business areas Ð Client Financing and Commercial Financing: \\nClient Financing: lease, installment payment plan and loan financing to end-user clients for terms up to seven years, and internal loan financing in support of IBM IaaS service arrangements. Assets financed are primarily new and used IT hardware, software and services where we have expertise. \\nCommercial Financing: short-term working capital financing to distributors and resellers primarily of IBM products. In 2019, we began the wind down of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) IT portion of our commercial financing operations which completed in early 2021. In the fourth-quarter 2020, Financing expanded its financial flexibility by entering into an agreement with a third-party investor to sell up to $3 billion of its IBM commercial financing receivables, at any one time, on a revolving basis over the agreementÕs three-year term. \\nHuman Capital \\nEmployees and Related Workforce \\n(In thousands) \t  For the year ended December 31: \t2021 \\nIBM/wholly owned subsidiaries \t  \t282.1  Less-than-wholly owned subsidiaries \t  \t9.8  \\n\tComplementary* \t  \t15.7  \\n \t \t \\n* The complementary workforce is an approximation of equivalent full-time employees hired under temporary, part-time and limited-term employment arrangements to meet specific business needs in a flexible and cost-effective manner. \\n \\nAs a globally integrated enterprise, IBM operates in more than 175 countries and is continuing to shift our business to the higher value segments of enterprise IT. Our global workforce is highly skilled, reflective of the work we do for our clientsÕ digital transformations and in support of their mission-critical operations. Our global workforce includes developers, consultants, client delivery and services specialists, research scientists and others. Our employees are among the worldÕs leading experts in cloud, AI, quantum computing, cybersecurity and industry-specific solutions. \\nIn November 2021, we completed the separation of our managed infrastructure services business to Kyndryl, comprising approximately 90,000 employees. Over our 111-year history, we have consistently made bold moves to transform and develop our talent. Today, IBM employees are clearly focused on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy for growth. \\nTalent and Culture  \\nIBM attracts, develops, engages and retains talent in a dynamic and competitive environment. IBM offers a compelling employee value proposition: we develop and deliver innovative technologies including hybrid cloud, AI, and quantum, for clients whose businesses the world relies on. IBM is continuously transforming and developing its talent, both through learning and hiring. Voluntary attrition was higher in 2021 than in 2020 consistent with the overall labor market. On a longer horizon, the average voluntary attrition rate of the pandemic years (2020 and 2021) was still lower than the previous two years (2018 and 2019). In 2021, we added skills in consulting and key technical areas. We are scaling our investments in garages, client engineering centers and customer success managers. Employees are encouraged and enabled to learn and grow their careers, with employees using our learning platform to complete more than 70 hours of learning on average in 2021. Our digital learning and career platform uses Watson AI to generate personalized recommendations and includes peer-to-peer collaboration and internal social sharing. Over 170,000 employees globally participated in our annual engagement survey, which measures factors such as workplace experience, inclusion, pride and propensity to recommend IBM as an employer. Our industry-leading talent practices enabled more than eight out of ten employees to be highly engaged. Every manager and leader in IBM has access to their team and organization engagement levels along with actionable datadriven insights.  \\nDiversity and Inclusion \\nIBM has a long, proud history as a pioneer in diversity and inclusion. A diverse and inclusive workplace leads to greater innovation, agility, performance, and engagement, enabling both business growth and societal impact. We ensure employees from diverse backgrounds are engaged, can be their authentic selves, build skills and grow their careers. In April 2021, with the full support of our Board of Directors, we disclosed an overview of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and programs, including diversity representation data and remain committed to continued transparency in 2022. We are proud of our inclusive culture, with nine out of ten employees responding that they can be their authentic selves at work. Our focus on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace led to increased levels of inclusion for women, Black and Hispanic employees. Women make up more than one-third of our workforce, and we increased representation of women, Black and Hispanic employees in 2021 compared to the prior year. In addition, executive representation of women globally, and Hispanic and Black executives in the U.S. improved by 1.0 point, 0.4 points and 1.5 points, respectively, in 2021. Further, a diversity modifier was added to the executive compensation program in 2021 to reinforce our continued accountability for progress. Globally, IBM executives are measured on the improvement of diversity and inclusion for women. In the U.S., executives are also measured on improvement of diversity and inclusion for U.S. underrepresented minorities. While we have taken significant actions and made progress, we have ongoing work to do. \\nIBM believes in pay equity: we have had an equal pay policy since 1935 and a long-standing practice of maintaining pay equity. To this end, we conduct statistical pay equity analysis that includes all countries with IBM employees. We also empower employees to understand their pay by providing comprehensive education and transparent access to pay statements including a comparison to market pay ranges. \\nHealth, Safety and Well-Being \\nWe have a long-standing commitment to the health, safety and well-being of our employees. This remained a focus in 2021 as we continued to face the COVID-19 pandemic. We have a robust case management system to manage COVID-19 exposures and a comprehensive playbook on workplace health and safety measures that allow our offices to reopen when local clinical conditions allow. These measures include limiting travel and in-person meetings and events, required self-screening before accessing workplaces, and imposing strict social distancing and mask wearing. In countries where vaccine access is sufficient or where legally mandated, only employees who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can access IBM workplaces. \\nAdditionally, from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, IBM has focused on mental health and supporting our employees for the long run with programs shaped by frequent survey polls and employee input sessions. Such programs include: four weeks additional paid time off for working parents and caregivers facing disruption, training for employees on resilience and for managers on how to identify and address mental health issues and financial counseling offerings tailored to pandemic-related matters. Employees are supported with 24/7 access to IBMÕs world-class Health and Safety team, education, timely updates and forums to ask questions and raise concerns. \\n \t \\nYEAR IN REVIEW \\nResults of Continuing Operations \\nAs discussed in the ÒOrganization of InformationÓ section, with the completion of the separation on November 3, 2021, results of Kyndryl are reported as discontinued operations. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation in the Management Discussion to allow for a meaningful comparison of continuing operations. \\nSegment Details \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, immediately prior to the separation of Kyndryl, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system to align the companyÕs operating model to its platform-centric approach to hybrid cloud and AI.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had incremental sales from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 2 points of full-year revenue growth. We had strong double-digit growth in Software hybrid cloud revenue as reported and adjusted for currency. There was strong growth in Hybrid Platform & Solutions, as reported and at constant currency, driven primarily by Red Hat, Security and Automation, as our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI solutions continued to resonate with our clients. Transaction Processing revenue decreased year to year as reported and adjusted for currency. Although a significant portion of the revenue in this area is annuity based, the timing of larger transactions is tied to client buying cycles and their preference for more consumption-like models which impacted sales of perpetual licenses. \\nHybrid Platform & Solutions revenue of $17,751 million increased 8.8 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency) in 2021 compared to the prior year. The incremental sales from Kyndryl in the fourth quarter of 2021 in Hybrid Platform & Solutions were not material to the full-year revenue growth. Red Hat revenue increased 30.6 percent as reported (30 percent adjusted for currency), with strong growth across infrastructure software and application development and emerging technologies, as RHEL and OpenShift address enterprisesÕ critical hybrid cloud requirements. We now have 3,800 clients on our hybrid cloud platform as of December 31, 2021, which was an increase of more than 1,000 clients compared to the prior year. Automation revenue increased 6.1 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting solid performance in AIOps and Management as we help our clients address resource management and observability. We are building our capabilities both organically and inorganically, and clients are realizing rapid time to value from our recent acquisitions including Instana and Turbonomic. Security revenue increased 6.8 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) with year-to-year growth across security software and services. Security innovation is an integral part of our strategy, and in the fourth quarter of 2021 we launched a new data security solution, Guardium Insights, and completed the acquisition of ReaQta. Data & AI revenue was flat year to year and declined 1 percent adjusted for currency. Within Data & AI, we had solid yearto-year growth in Data Fabric as well as our Business Analytics and Weather offerings. \\nTransaction Processing revenue of $6,390 million decreased 3.3 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) in 2021 compared to the prior year. Incremental sales from Kyndryl in the fourth quarter of 2021 contributed approximately 5 points of fullyear revenue growth. In 2021, clients continued their preference for operating expenses over capital expenditures, which continued to put pressure on perpetual licenses, in favor of more consumption-like models. Our subscription and support renewal rate was stronger in 2021 compared to the prior year, reflecting our clientsÕ commitment to our infrastructure platform and our high-value software offerings. \\nWithin Software, hybrid cloud revenue of $8.7 billion grew 26 percent as reported and 25 percent adjusted for currency year to year, driven by Red Hat as well as our software that has been optimized for our hybrid cloud platform which helps our clients apply AI, automation and security across their environments to transform and improve their business workflows. \\n($ in millions) \\n\\n\\n\\nYr.-to-Yr. \\nPercent/ Margin \\nFor the year ended December 31: Software \\n2021     \\n2020 * \\nChange \\nGross profit \\nGross profit margin \\n$ 19,014  \\n78.8  %   \\n$17,958  78.3  %   \\n5.9 \\n0.4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n %  pts. \\nPre-tax income \t$ 4,722  $ 3,341  41.3  % Pre-tax margin \t19.6  %   14.6  %   5.0  pts. \\n* Recast to reflect segment changes. \\nThe Software gross profit margin increased 0.4 points to 78.8 percent in 2021 compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income of $4,722 million increased 41.3 percent compared to the prior year with a pre-tax margin expansion of 5.0 points to 19.6 percent. The increase in pre-tax income and margin reflects the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year, which resulted in a 3.3 points improvement in the pre-tax margin compared to 2020. \\nConsulting \\n($ in millions) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYr.-to-Yr.  \\n\\n\\n\\nYr.-to-Yr.  \\nPercent Change  \\n\\n\\n\\nPercent  \\nAdjusted for  \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n2021     \\n2020 * \\nChange     \\nCurrency  \\nConsulting revenue \\n$17,844  \\n$16,257  \\n9.8  %   \\n8.3  % \\nBusiness Transformation \\n$ 8,284  \\n$ 7,193  \\n15.2  %   \\n13.4  % \\nTechnology Consulting \\n \t3,466  \\n \t3,133  \\n10.6 \\n10.1 \\nApplication Operations \\n6,095  \\n \t5,931  \\n2.8 \\n1.2 \\n* Recast to reflect segment changes. \\nConsulting revenue of $17,844 million increased 9.8 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency) in 2021 compared to the prior year, with growth across all three business areas. Clients are accelerating their business transformations and are turning to IBM Consulting as their trusted partner to help drive innovation, increase agility and productivity, and capture new growth opportunities, powered by hybrid cloud and AI. We had strong double-digit growth in Consulting hybrid cloud revenue as reported and adjusted for currency. Our total Consulting signings in 2021 grew at a mid-single-digit rate compared to the prior year and our book-to-bill for 2021 was 1.1. Consulting continued to drive hybrid cloud platform adoption by our clients, with approximately 700 Red Hat engagements in 2021. Our strategic acquisitions and expansion of strategic partnerships also contributed to our year-to-year revenue growth in 2021.  \\nBusiness Transformation revenue of $8,284 million increased 15.2 percent as reported (13 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. We had strong demand for our Business Transformation solutions, with good performance across all service lines including growth in offerings such as data platform services, Salesforce consulting services, and SAP consulting services and solutions.  \\nTechnology Consulting revenue of $3,466 million increased 10.6 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency) driven primarily by growth in high-value offerings to develop cloud native applications and modernize existing applications for the cloud. \\nApplication Operations revenue of $6,095 million increased 2.8 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by offerings which provide end-to-end management of custom applications in cloud environments, reflecting our clientsÕ trust in IBM Consulting to operate and manage their critical applications whether running in the cloud or on-premises environments.  \\nWithin Consulting, hybrid cloud revenue of $7.9 billion grew 34 percent as reported and 32 percent adjusted for currency, driven by Red Hat-related signings focused on modernizing clientsÕ applications and revenue from consulting engagements in the areas of our strategic partnerships, such as Salesforce, SAP, AWS and Azure. \\n($ in millions) \\n\\n \\n\\n  \t \\n  \t \\n \t \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \t \t \\n \t \t \\nYr.-to-Yr.   \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \t \t \\n \t \t \\nPercent/   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \t \t \\n \t \t \\nMargin   \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n\\n     \\n\\n2021      \\n2020 * \\nChange  \\nConsulting \\n\\n \\n\\n \t \\n  \t \\n \t \\nGross profit \\nGross profit margin \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n$ 4,994    28.0  % \\n$ 4,760    29.3  % \\n4.9  % \\n(1.3)pts. \\nPre-tax income \\n\\n  \\n\\n$ 1,449   \\n$ 1,034   \\n40.1  % \\n \tPre-tax margin \\n\\n  \\n\\n   \t8.1   % \\n   \t6.4   % \\n \t1.8   pts. \\n* Recast to reflect segment changes. \\n \\nThe Consulting gross profit margin decreased 1.3 points to 28.0 percent compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income of $1,449 million increased 40.1 percent compared to the prior year and the pre-tax margin increased 1.8 points to 8.1 percent. The decline in gross profit margin reflects our investment in new offerings, integrating and scaling our acquisitions, as well as increased labor costs due to the competitive labor market which were not yet reflected in our pricing. The year-to-year improvement in pre-tax income reflects increased gross profit dollars driven by growth in revenue. The increase in pre-tax margin compared to the prior year was driven primarily by the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year, which resulted in a 2.9 points improvement in the pre-tax margin, which was partially offset by the decline in gross profit margin. \\nConsulting Signings and Book-to-Bill \\n($ in millions) \\n\\n \\n\\n  \t \\n  \t \\n \t \t \t \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \t \t \\n \t \t \\n\t \t \tYr.-to-Yr.   \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \t \t \\n \t \t \\nYr.-to-Yr.  \tPercent Change   \\n\\n \\n\\n     \\n \t \t     \\n \t \t     \\nPercent      \tAdjusted for   \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n\\n  \\n\\n2021   \\n2020 * \\nChange   \tCurrency  \\n Total Consulting signings \\n\\n   \\n\\n $19,163  \t   \\n $18,018  \t   \\n \t6.4   %    \t5.8   % \\n* Recast to conform to 2021 presentation, reflecting the separation of Kyndryl on November 3, 2021. \\nSignings are managementÕs initial estimate of the value of a clientÕs commitment under a services contract within IBM Consulting. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clientÕs commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs. \\nContract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Total signings can vary over time due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of signing a small number of larger contracts. Signings associated with an acquisition will be recognized on a prospective basis. \\nManagement believes the estimated values of signings disclosed provide an indication of our forward-looking revenue. Signings are used to monitor the performance of the business and viewed as useful information for management and shareholders. The conversion of signings into revenue may vary based on the types of services and solutions, contract duration, customer decisions, and other factors, which may include, but are not limited to, the macroeconomic environment. \\nBook-to-bill represents the ratio of IBM Consulting signings to its revenue over the same period. The metric is a useful indicator of the demand of our business over time. This definition should be read in conjunction with the signings definition noted above. \\nInfrastructure \\n($ in millions) \\n\\n \\n  \t \\n\\n  \t \\n\\n \t \t \t \\n \\n\\n     \\n \t \\n     \\n \t \\n     \\n\t     \t     \tYr.-to-Yr.   \\n \\n\\n \\n \t \\n \\n \t \\n \\nYr.-to-Yr.  \tPercent Change   \\n\\n \\n \\n \t \\n \\n \t \\n \\nPercent  \tAdjusted for   \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n\\n  \\n2021   \\n\\n2020 * \\n\\nChange   \tCurrency  \\nInfrastructure revenue \\n\\n  \\n$14,188   \\n\\n$14,533   \\n\\n\t(2.4) %   \t(3.4)% \\nHybrid Infrastructure \\n\\n  \\n$ 8,167   \\n\\n$ 8,415   \\n\\n\t(2.9) %   \t(3.7)% \\nIBM Z \\n\\n \\n \t \\n\\n \t  \\n\\n\t(4.9)  \t(5.4) \\n\tDistributed Infrastructure \t \t \t \t \t  \t(1.8)  \t(2.6) \\n\t \tInfrastructure Support \t  \t  \t 6,021   \t  \t 6,118    \t \t(1.6)   \t \t(3.0)  \\n \\n* Recast to reflect segment changes. \\nInfrastructure revenue of $14,188 million decreased 2.4 percent year to year as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency). In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had incremental sales from Kyndryl, representing approximately 1 point of growth in full-year revenue. The overall decline in revenue reflects our product cycle dynamics. Although impacted by product cycles, our portfolio of products continues to provide critical and lasting value to our clients in support of their hybrid cloud and digital transformation journeys, and we continue to innovate and refresh our product portfolio to deliver enhanced technologies to our clients. \\nHybrid Infrastructure revenue of $8,167 million declined 2.9 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency). Revenue in 2021 included incremental sales from Kyndryl in fourth quarter, representing approximately 1 point of growth in full-year revenue. The overall decline in revenue reflects product cycle dynamics in IBM Z and our Distributed Infrastructure platforms. IBM Z revenue decreased 4.9 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) as we concluded the tenth quarter of z15 availability at the end of 2021. The z15 program continued to outpace the success of the prior program and we shipped more MIPS in the z15 program than any program in our history. Clients continued to leverage IBM Z as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure and its combination of security, scalability, reliability, cloud native development, and newer flexible consumption offerings demonstrate the value of the IBM Z platform within our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Distributed Infrastructure revenue declined 1.8 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by declines in Power and Cloud Platform, partially offset by growth in Storage solutions driven by demand from hyperscalers for our tape products. In the third-quarter 2021, our next generation Power 10 became available within the high-end system which has unique hardware innovations, including a processor specifically optimized for data intensive workloads such as SAP S/4HANA. \\nInfrastructure Support revenue of $6,021 million declined 1.6 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. The fourth-quarter incremental sales from Kyndryl represented approximately 2 points of growth in full-year revenue. The overall decline in revenue in 2021 reflects the hardware product cycles. \\nWithin Infrastructure, hybrid cloud revenue of $3.6 billion declined 10 percent as reported and 11 percent adjusted for currency, driven primarily by product cycle dynamics. \\n($ in millions) \\n\\n \\n\\n  \t \\n  \t \\n \t \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \t \t \\n \t \t \\nYr.-to-Yr.   \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \t \t \\n \t \t \\nPercent/   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \t \t \\n \t \t \\nMargin   \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n\\n\\n     \\n2021      \\n2020 * \\nChange      \\nInfrastructure \\n\\n \\n\\n  \t \\n \t \\n \\nGross profit \\nGross profit margin \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n$ 7,848    55.3  % \\n$ 8,359    57.5  % \\n(6.1)% (2.2)pts. \\nPre-tax income \\n\\n  \\n\\n$ 2,025   \\n$ 1,654   \\n22.4  % \\n \tPre-tax margin \\n\\n  \\n\\n   14.3   % \\n   11.4   % \\n \t2.9   pts. \\n* Recast to reflect segment changes. \\nThe Infrastructure gross profit margin decreased 2.2 points to 55.3 percent in 2021 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by margin declines in Distributed Infrastructure reflecting product cycle dynamics, partially offset by margin improvement in IBM Z.

Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) in 2021 was $1,547 million, a decrease of $191 million year to year primarily driven by a lower average debt balance in the current year. \\nStock-Based Compensation \\nPre-tax stock-based compensation cost of $919 million increased $45 million compared to 2020. This was primarily due to increases related to the conversion of options previously issued by acquired entities ($30 million) and restricted stock units ($25 million), partially offset by a decrease from performance share units ($10 million). Stock-based compensation cost, and the yearto-year change, was reflected in the following categories: Cost: $145 million, up $19 million; SG&A expense: $555 million, up $5 million; and RD&E expense: $218 million, up $21 million. \\nRetirement-Related Plans \\nThe following table provides the total pre-tax cost for all retirement-related plans.

Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in 2021 were $1,320 million, a decrease of $59 million compared to 2020. Non-operating costs of $1,282 million in 2021 increased $209 million year to year, driven primarily by the same factors as above. \\nIncome Taxes \\nThe continuing operations effective tax rate for 2021 was 2.6 percent compared to (52.9) percent in 2020. The current-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by tax benefits related to audit settlements in multiple jurisdictions. The prior-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion related to an intra-entity sale of certain of the companyÕs intellectual property in the first quarter of 2020, and a benefit of $0.2 billion related to a foreign tax law change. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2021 was 9.0 percent compared to (11.5) percent in 2020. The prior year operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was primarily driven by the net tax benefit from the intra-entity IP sale.

We continue to manage the investment portfolio to meet our liquidity objectives. \\nCash, restricted cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2021 were $7,556 million, a decrease of $6,695 million compared to prior year end, as we continued to actively de-lever our debt, invested $3,293 million in acquisitions and provided a growing dividend to our shareholders. Financing receivables declined $4,540 million to $13,439 million since the end of 2020 primarily due to the strategic actions taken to re-focus our Financing portfolio. Assets from discontinued operations declined $15,764 million due to the separation of Kyndryl, which occurred on November 3, 2021.  \\nTotal debt of $51,703 million decreased $9,629 million from prior year end. We have reduced total debt $21,307 million since the end of the second quarter of 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition). We have made good progress in deleveraging while being acquisitive and without sacrificing investments in our business or our solid dividend policy. Liabilities from discontinued operations declined $7,136 million due to the separation of Kyndryl. \\nOur cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis and includes 10 months of Kyndryl operations for 2021 versus a full year of Kyndryl operations for 2020. During 2021, we generated $12,796 million in cash from operating activities, a decrease of $5,401 million compared to 2020. Our cash from operating activities for 2021 reflects cash paid in 2021 for separation charges and structural actions initiated in the fourth-quarter 2020. We returned $5,869 million to shareholders through dividends in 2021. Our cash generation permits us to invest and deploy capital to areas with the most attractive long-term opportunities. \\nConsistent with accounting standards, the company remeasured the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans at December 31. At December 31, 2021, the overall net underfunded position was $5,450 million, a decrease of $5,033 million from December 31, 2020, driven by higher discount rates partially offset by modest asset returns. At year end, our qualified defined benefit plans were well-funded and the required contributions related to these plans and multi-employer plans are expected to be approximately $200 million in 2022. In 2021, the return on the U.S. Personal Pension Plan assets was 2.0 percent and the plan was 112 percent funded at December 31, 2021. Overall, global asset returns were 3.0 percent and the qualified defined benefit plans worldwide were 107 percent funded at December 31, 2021. \\nIBM Working Capital \\n\t($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t \t  \\nAt December 31: \t     2021      2020* Current assets \t  $ 29,539   $ 36,547  Current liabilities \t   33,619     36,049  \\nWorking capital \t  $ (4,080) $ 498  Current ratio  \t      0.88:1       1.01:1 \\n* Amounts presented exclude the current assets and current liabilities of discontinued operations of $2,618 million and $3,820 million, respectively. \\nWorking capital decreased $4,577 million from the year-end 2020 position. The key changes are described below: \\nCurrent assets decreased $7,008 million ($6,060 million adjusted for currency) due to: \\n¥ A decrease of $6,695 million ($6,464 million adjusted for currency) in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities due to debt paydown, investments in acquisitions and dividend payments; and \\n¥ A decline in receivables of $1,607 million ($1,115 million adjusted for currency) mainly due to sales of financing receivables; partially offset by \\n¥ An increase of $1,378 million ($1,536 million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to investment in Kyndryl of $807 million and an increase in derivative assets.  \\nCurrent liabilities decreased $2,430 million ($1,080 million adjusted for currency) as a result of: \\n¥ A decrease in other accrued expenses and liabilities of $1,740 million ($1,188 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to payments of $1,640 million for workforce rebalancing actions; \\n¥ A decrease in taxes payable of $909 million ($777 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by tax payments and a decline in reserves as a result of the resolution of certain tax audit matters; and \\n¥ A decrease in short-term debt of $329 million ($317 million adjusted for currency) due to maturities of $7,155 million; partially offset by reclassifications of $6,792 million from long-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities; partially offset by \\n¥ An increase in deferred income of $538 million ($926 million adjusted for currency). \\nReceivables and Allowances \\nRoll Forward of Total IBM Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n($ in millions) \\n\t \t \tAdditions/ \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n\tJanuary 1, 2021 \t     \t(Releases) *     \tWrite-offs **    \tOther ??\tDecember 31, 2021 \\n\t$ 550  \t$ (56) \t$ (46)\t$ (5)\t$ 443 \\n* Additions/(Releases) for Allowance for Credit Losses are recorded in expense. \\n** Refer to note A, ÒSignificant Accounting Policies,Ó for additional information regarding allowance for credit losses write-offs. \\n?

The decrease in coverage and decrease in allowance were driven by the overall decrease in receivables and an improvement in certain customersÕ credit quality given the improvement of the macroeconomic environment since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. The majority of the write-offs during the year related to receivables which had been previously reserved. \\nFinancing Segment Receivables and Allowances \\nThe following table presents external Financing segment receivables, excluding receivables classified as held for sale, and immaterial miscellaneous receivables. \\n($ in millions) \\n \\n \t \\n \\n \t \t  \\nAt December 31: \\n     \\n2021      \\n\\n2020  \\nAmortized cost* \\n  \\n$ 12,859   \\n\\n$ 17,881  \\nSpecific allowance for credit losses \\n \\n \t159  \\n\\n \t184  \\nUnallocated allowance for credit losses \\n \\n \t42  \\n\\n \t79  \\nTotal allowance for credit losses \\n \\n \t201  \\n\\n \t263  \\nNet financing receivables \\n  \\n$ 12,658   \\n\\n$ 17,618  \\n Allowance for credit losses coverage \\n  \\n   \t1.6   % \\n\\n   \t1.5   % \\n* Includes deferred initial direct costs which are expensed in IBMÕs consolidated financial results. \\nThe percentage of Financing segment receivables reserved increased from 1.5 percent at December 31, 2020 to 1.6 percent at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by the decline in amortized cost, which reflects the strategic actions described in Financing\\'s \\\"Results of Operations.Ó \\n \\nRoll Forward of Financing Segment Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses (included in Total IBM) \\n($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t   \t \tAdditions/ \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n\tJanuary 1, 2021 \t     \t(Releases) * \tWrite-offs ** \tOther ??\tDecember 31, 2021 \\n\t$   263  \t   \t \t$(39)   \t \t \t$(17) \t   \t \t$ (5)   \t \t \t$201  \t \\n* Additions/(Releases) for Allowance for Credit Losses are recorded in expense. \\n**  Refer to note A, ÒSignificant Accounting Policies,Ó for additional information regarding allowance for credit loss write-offs. \\n??Primarily represents translation adjustments.  \\nFinancingÕs expected credit loss expense (including reserves for off-balance sheet commitments which are recorded in other liabilities) was a release of $54 million in 2021, compared to an addition of $34 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower reserves in Americas and EMEA, due to the overall improvement in the quality of our portfolio, as well as lower future funding commitments reserves related to the separation of Kyndryl. \\nNoncurrent Assets and Liabilities \\n\t($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t \t  \\nAt December 31: \t     2021      2020* Noncurrent assets \t  $ 102,462  $ 103,660 Long-term debt \t  $ 44,917  $ 54,217 \\n\tNoncurrent liabilities (excluding debt)   \t   \t $ 34,469 \t   \t $ 37,842 \t \\n* Amounts presented exclude the noncurrent assets ($13,147 million) and noncurrent liabilities ($3,317 million), including long-term debt, of discontinued operations. \\n \\n \\n \\nThe decrease in noncurrent assets of $1,198 million (an increase of $967 million adjusted for currency) was driven by: \\n¥ A decrease in long-term financing receivables of $1,662 million ($1,425 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to volumes decline and sales of receivables; and \\n¥ A decrease in deferred taxes of $1,034 million ($735 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to pension plan remeasurements, foreign audit settlements and realization of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions; and \\n¥ A decrease in net property, plant and equipment of $511 million ($315 million adjusted for currency); and  \\n¥ A decrease of $934 million ($587 million adjusted for currency) in total operating right-of-use assets, deferred costs and investments and sundry assets; partially offset by \\n¥ An increase in prepaid pension assets of $2,293 million ($2,405 million adjusted for currency) driven by plan remeasurements and higher returns on plan assets; and \\n¥ An increase in goodwill and net intangible assets of $650 million ($1,625 million adjusted for currency) due to additions from new acquisitions, partially offset by intangibles amortization. \\nLong-term debt decreased $9,300 million ($8,092 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by: ¥ \tReclassifications to short-term debt of $6,792 million to reflect upcoming maturities; and \\n¥ Early redemption of IBM Credit debt of $1,250 million. \\nNoncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) decreased $3,372 million ($1,680 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by: \\n¥ A decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations of $2,749 million ($1,875 million adjusted for currency) mainly driven by plan remeasurements; and \\n¥ A decrease of $623 million (an increase of $195 million adjusted for currency) in operating lease liabilities, other liabilities and deferred income. \\nDebt \\nOur funding requirements are continually monitored and we execute our strategies to manage the overall asset and liability profile.

Financing segment debt includes debt of $1,345 million in 2021 and $4,311 million in 2020 to support intercompany financing receivables and other intercompany assets. Refer to FinancingÕs ÒFinancial PositionÓ on page 55 for additional details. \\n \\nTotal debt of $51,703 million decreased $9,629 million ($8,410 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2020, primarily driven by early retirements and debt maturities of $8,557 million. Total debt decreased $21,307 million since the end of the second quarter 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition). \\nNon-Financing debt of $37,775 million decreased $2,460 million ($1,640 million adjusting for currency) from December 31, 2020 due to scheduled debt maturities during 2021. \\nFinancing segment debt of $13,929 million decreased $7,170 million ($6,770 million adjusting for currency) from December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower external funding requirements associated with financing receivables, as well as lower internal funding requirements after the separation of Kyndryl. In the first quarter of 2021, IBM Credit early redeemed all of its outstanding fixed-rate debt in the aggregate amount of $1.75 billion and deregistered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \\nFinancing provides financing solutions predominantly for IBMÕs external client assets, and the debt used to fund Financing assets is primarily composed of intercompany loans. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on armÕs-length pricing. The Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at December 31, 2021. \\nWe measure Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting FinancingÕs external client and internal business is included in the ÒFinancing Results of OperationsÓ and in note E, ÒSegments.Ó In the Consolidated Income Statement, the external debt-related interest expense supporting FinancingÕs internal financing to the company is classified as interest expense. \\nEquity \\nTotal equity decreased $1,731 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease of $7,203 million related to the separation of Kyndryl and dividends paid of $5,869 million; partially offset by increases from net income of $5,743 million, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $4,839 driven by retirement-related benefit plans ($3,828 million), cash flow hedges ($438 million) and foreign currency translation adjustments ($573 million), and common stock of $762 million. \\nCash Flow \\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 65 are summarized in the table below and include the cash flows of discontinued operations. These amounts also include the cash flows associated with the Financing business. \\n\t($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t \t  \\nFor the year ended December 31: \t     \\n2021      \\n2020 \\nNet cash provided by/(used in) \t \\n  \t \\n  \\nOperating activities \t  \\n$ 12,796   \\n$ 18,197 \\nInvesting activities \t \\n \t(5,975) \\n  (3,028)\\n Financing activities \t  (13,354)   (9,721) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash   (185)   (87) Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash   $ (6,718) $ 5,361  \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $5,401 million in 2021 driven by the following key factors: \\n¥ A decrease of cash provided by receivables of $3,925 million primarily driven by higher volumes in trade receivables; \\n¥ A decrease in payroll tax and value-added tax payment liabilities of approximately $1,000 million due to payments in the current year for tax relief provided under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs in 2020 related to COVID-19; and \\n¥ An increase in payments for structural actions and Kyndryl separation-related charges; partially offset by performance related improvements within net income.  \\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $2,947 million driven by: \\n¥ An increase in net cash used for acquisitions of $2,958 million aligned with our hybrid cloud and AI strategy; \\n¥ A decrease of $475 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables primarily driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations; and \\n¥ A decrease in cash provided by divestitures of $389 million; partially offset by \\n¥ A decrease in cash used for net capital expenditures of $661 million. \\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $3,633 million driven by: \\n¥ A decrease in net cash provided by debt transactions of $4,401 million driven primarily by a higher level of net additions in the prior year, partially offset by a lower level of maturities in the current year; partially offset by \\n¥ An increase in cash provided of $879 million due to Kyndryl distribution to IBM at separation. \\nDiscontinued Operations \\nPre-tax income from discontinued operations of $1,744 million in 2021 decreased 18.6 percent compared to the prior year. As the separation of Kyndryl occurred on November 3, 2021, the current year included 10 months of Kyndryl operations compared with a full year in 2020. The current year also included a higher level of separation-related charges. These dynamics were partially offset by higher charges for structural actions in the prior year. The discontinued operations provision for income taxes in 2021 was $714 million compared with $484 million in 2020. The current-year provision included tax charges related to the Kyndryl separation.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.72 as reported and $3.35 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. On a consolidated basis, we generated $2.5 billion in cash from operations, $3.3 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $1.5 billion in dividends. These results reflect the strong demand we see in the marketplace for our technology and consulting. We continue to invest in skills, innovation and our ecosystem to position us for 2022 and the longer term. \\nTotal revenue increased 6.5 percent as reported and 9 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year with strong performance in our key growth areas of software and consulting. Fourth-quarter 2021 also includes incremental revenue from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 3.5 points of our total revenue growth. Software increased 8.2 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency, with growth in both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. Within this segment, Hybrid Platform & Solutions grew 7.1 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency), with Red Hat delivering strong double-digit growth. Transaction Processing revenue grew from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl. Consulting increased 13.1 percent as reported and 16 percent adjusted for currency with growth across all business areas. Consulting growth was led by Business Transformation which grew 17.9 percent as reported and 20 percent adjusted for currency reflecting strong demand for solutions to transform critical workflows. Infrastructure decreased 0.2 percent as reported but grew 2 percent adjusted for currency including a benefit from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. Across the segments, total IBM hybrid cloud revenue of $6.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 grew 16 percent as reported and 18 percent adjusted for currency. \\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas revenue increased 6.6 percent year to year as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency). EMEA increased 3.6 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific increased 10.9 percent year to year as reported (16 percent adjusted for currency). \\nThe gross margin was 56.9 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) gross margin was 58.0 percent, both decreasing  2.0 points year to year. Overall, gross margin was impacted by the significant investments we are making to drive our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and a competitive labor market which has impacted labor costs due to higher acquisition, retention and wage costs.  \\nTotal expense and other (income) decreased 19.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 versus the prior-year period primarily driven by a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2020 for structural actions to simplify and optimize our operating model and improve our position going forward. This decrease was partially offset by increased spending as we continue to invest to drive growth and scale resources to better serve our clients. We are also increasing our research spend to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas such as quantum and expanding our ecosystem. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 19.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors. \\nPre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.9 billion increased $1.9 billion and the pre-tax margin was 17.2 percent, an increase of 10.7 points versus the prior-year period, primarily due to the prior-year workforce rebalancing charge. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 14.2 percent compared to an effective tax rate of (17.3) percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. The prior-year tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical mix of pre-tax income, including from structural actions taken in 2020. Net income from continuing operations was $2.5 billion, an increase of 106.9 percent year to year. The net income margin from continuing operations was 14.7 percent, an  increase of 7.2 points from the prior-year period. \\nOperating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $3.5 billion increased 101.9 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations increased 10.0 points to 21.2 percent, primarily due to the prior-year workforce rebalancing charge. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 14.2 percent versus 3.7 percent in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the same factors described above. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $3.0 billion increased 80.0 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 18.2 percent, up 7.4 points year to year. \\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.72 in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 106.1 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $3.35 increased 78.2 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively. \\n \t \\nResults of Continuing Operations \\nAs discussed in the ÒOrganization of InformationÓ section, with the completion of the separation on November 3, 2021, results of Kyndryl are reported as discontinued operations. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation in the Management Discussion to allow for a meaningful comparison of continuing operations. \\nSegment Details \\nThe following is an analysis of the fourth quarter of 2021 versus the fourth quarter of 2020 reportable segment revenue and gross margin results. Segment pre-tax income includes certain limited transactions, predominantly between the Financing and Infrastructure segments, that are recorded to other income and excludes certain unallocated corporate items.

Fourth-quarter 2021 includes incremental revenue from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 5 points of revenue growth. We had double-digit growth in total hybrid cloud revenue within the segment as reported and adjusted for currency. We had continued strength in our Hybrid Platform & Solutions portfolio, led by Red Hat, Automation and Data & AI. Transaction Processing revenue grew in the fourth quarter with all the growth coming from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl.  \\nHybrid Platform & Solutions revenue of $5,140 million increased 7.1 percent as reported (9 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. This revenue performance reflects the strength across the software growth areas that focus on hybrid cloud and AI, and includes incremental revenue in fourth-quarter 2021 from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 1 point of revenue growth. Red Hat revenue grew 18.6 percent as reported (21 percent adjusted for currency) driven primarily by strong  growth in infrastructure and double-digit growth in application development and emerging technologies, as RHEL and OpenShift address enterprisesÕ critical hybrid cloud requirements. Automation revenue increased 12.8 percent as reported (15 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by good performance in AIOps and management that address resource management and observability, as well as continued growth in Cloud Pak for Integration. Data & AI revenue grew 1.4 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) reflecting the strength in Data Fabric which enables clients to connect siloed data that is distributed across a hybrid cloud landscape. Within Data & AI, we also had strong performance in our business analytics and weather offerings. Within Security, although we had growth in the full-year 2021, revenue in the fourth quarter declined 2.3 points as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) driven by lower performance in Data Security. Security innovation is an integral part of our strategy and in the fourth quarter, we launched a new data security solution, Guardium Insights, and acquired ReaQta which leverages AI and machine learning to automatically identify and block threats. \\nWithin Hybrid Platform & Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our Hybrid Platform & Solutions business within the Software segment. ARR is calculated by estimating the current quarterÕs recurring, committed value for certain types of active contracts as of the period-end date and then multiplying that value by four. This value is based on each arrangementÕs contract value and start date, mitigating fluctuations during the contract term, and includes the following consumption models: (1) software subscription agreements, including committed term licenses, (2) as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, (3) maintenance and support contracts, and (4) security managed services contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent the amount of revenue recognized in the period and therefore is not intended to represent current period revenue or revenue that will be recognized in future periods. \\nTransaction Processing revenue of $2,133 million increased 11.2 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. Fourth-quarter 2021 includes incremental revenue from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 16 points of revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, we also had some large perpetual license transactions given the expansion in IBM Z capacity driven by the z15 program, as well as strong renewal rates which is proof of our clientÕs commitment to our infrastructure platform and our high-value software offerings. \\nWithin Software, total hybrid cloud revenue of $2.7 billion grew 22 percent as reported (24 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period reflecting our clientsÕ demand for our Hybrid Platform & Solutions offerings. \\nSoftware gross profit margin of 80.9 percent increased 0.4 points year to year compared to the prior-year period. Pre-tax income of $2,109 million increased 83.2 percent and pre-tax margin increased 11.9 points to 29.0 percent, reflecting the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year which resulted in 9.7 points of improvement on the pre-tax margin. \\nConsulting \\nConsulting revenue of $4,746 million increased 13.1 percent as reported (16 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. We had strong growth year to year in all three business areas, led by Business Transformation, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.2. We had double-digit growth in total hybrid cloud revenue in the segment as reported and adjusted for currency. Clients are accelerating their business transformations, powered by hybrid cloud and AI, to drive innovation, increase their agility and productivity, and capture new growth opportunities. Enterprises are turning to IBM Consulting as their trusted partner on their transformation journey and are leveraging our deep client, industry and technical expertise, which helps drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform.  \\nBusiness Transformation revenue of $2,213 million increased 17.9 percent as reported (20 percent adjusted for currency). This business area brings together technology and strategic consulting to transform critical workflows at scale. We enable this by leveraging our skills and capabilities in IBM technologies along with our strategic ecosystem partners. Our practices are centered on areas such as finance and supply chain, talent, industry-specific solutions and digital design. This quarter, we had broad-based revenue growth reflecting strong demand for these solutions. \\nTechnology Consulting revenue of $928 million increased 14.4 percent as reported (19 percent adjusted for currency). Technology Consulting architects and implements cloud platforms and strategies, leveraging hybrid cloud with Red Hat OpenShift. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see good performance in application modernization offerings that build cloud native applications as well as modernize existing applications for the cloud. \\nApplication Operations revenue of $1,605 million increased 6.5 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency). This business area focuses on application and cloud platform services required to operationalize and run in both cloud and on-premise environments. The growth in fourth-quarter revenue was driven by offerings which provide end-to-end management of custom applications in cloud environments. \\nWithin Consulting, hybrid cloud revenue of $2.2 billion grew 31 percent as reported (34 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period, reflecting strong double-digit growth across all three business areas. Consulting Red Hat-related signings more than doubled year to year in the fourth quarter, as we added over 150 engagements in the quarter. Our hybrid cloud revenue from our strategic partnerships grew at a solid double-digit rate in the fourth quarter on a year-to-year basis.  \\nConsulting fourth-quarter gross profit margin of 27.0 percent decreased 2.7 points year to year. The gross profit margin decline was across all three business areas. We are in a competitive labor market and continued to have increased pressure on labor costs. We expect to capture this increased resource cost in engagements going forward, however, this will take time to be reflected in our future profit profile. Pre-tax income increased $374 million to $436 million and pre-tax margin increased 7.7 points to 9.2 percent compared to the prior-year period. The increase in pre-tax income and margin reflects the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year which resulted in 9.4 points of improvement on the pre-tax margin. \\nInfrastructure \\nInfrastructure revenue of $4,414 million decreased 0.2 percent as reported, but increased 2 percent adjusted for currency in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. The incremental sales from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl contributed approximately 5 points of revenue growth in the fourth quarter. By bringing together Hybrid Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support (formerly Technology Support Services), we can now better manage the lifecycle of our hardware platform and provide end-to-end value for our clients.  \\nHybrid Infrastructure revenue of $2,873 million was flat as reported and grew 2 percent adjusted for currency in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. In the fourth quarter, the incremental sales from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl contributed approximately 4 points of revenue growth. Distributed Infrastructure grew 4.7 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency, driven primarily by revenue growth across our storage portfolio, partially offset by declines in Power and Cloud IaaS. IBM Z revenue decreased 5.9 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) reflecting the z15 product cycle. This was the tenth quarter of z15 availability and the program continues to outpace the strong z14 program with more MIPS shipped than any program in our history. With its combination of security, scalability and reliability, the z15 continues to resonate with our clients, who are leveraging IBM Z as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure.  \\nInfrastructure Support revenue of $1,541 million decreased 0.9 percent as reported, but grew 1 percent adjusted for currency in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year. The Infrastructure Support business benefited from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, which contributed incremental revenue representing approximately 6 points of revenue growth in the fourth quarter. \\nWithin Infrastructure, hybrid cloud revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 12 percent as reported (11 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by the IBM Z and Distributed Infrastructure product cycles. \\nThe Infrastructure gross profit margin decreased 5.3 points to 54.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. Pre-tax income of $1,036 million increased 64.6 percent and the pre-tax margin increased 9.2 points year to year to 23.5 percent. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by declines in margins across the Hybrid Infrastructure product portfolio and margin decline in Infrastructure Support. The increase in pre-tax income and margin reflects the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year, which resulted in 9.4 points of improvement in the pre-tax margin. \\nFinancing \\nFinancing revenue of $172 million decreased 29.4 percent as reported (29 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, primarily driven by declines in client financing revenue due to a lower average asset balance. Financing\\'s fourth-quarter pre-tax income decreased 27.9 percent to $79 million and the pre-tax margin of 46.0 percent increased 0.9 points year to year. The decrease in pretax income was driven by the lower average asset balance noted above which reflects the strategic actions described in FinancingÕs ÒResults of Operations.Ó \\nGeographic Revenue \\nTotal revenue of $16,695 million increased 6.5 percent as reported and 9 percent adjusted for currency in the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period. Fourth-quarter 2021 includes incremental revenue from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 3.5 points of revenue growth. \\nAmericas revenue of $8,121 million increased 6.6 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency.

The year-to-year decrease was primarily driven by the fourth-quarter 2020 charge for structural actions (18 points), impact of currency (3 points), non-operating Kyndryl-related benefits (1 point) and shared services expense transferred to Kyndryl at separation (1 point), partially offset by higher spending (3 points) and higher non-operating retirement-related costs (1 point). Our expense dynamics reflect a higher level of investment in innovation, skills and our ecosystem, both organically and through acquisitions, as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We are aggressively hiring and scaling resources to better serve clients, while increasing our research spend to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas such as quantum, and we are expanding our ecosystem.  \\nTotal operating (non-GAAP) expense and other income decreased 19.8 percent year to year, primarily driven by the same factors described above, excluding the non-operating Kyndryl-related benefits and higher non-operating retirement-related costs. \\nCash Flow \\nOn a consolidated basis, we generated $2.5 billion in cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of $3.3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily driven by a decrease in cash provided by receivables of $2.5 billion which includes one month of KyndrylÕs results. Net cash used in investing activities of $0.7 billion was $0.1 billion higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables ($0.4 billion), partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures ($0.3 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $2.7 billion decreased $3.6 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower net reductions in debt ($2.8 billion) and net cash proceeds from the Kyndryl distribution to IBM upon separation ($0.9 billion). \\nResults of Discontinued Operations \\nPre-tax income/(loss) from discontinued operations, was a loss of $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to income of $354 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. As the separation of Kyndryl occurred on November 3, 2021, the fourth-quarter 2021 included a partial quarter of Kyndryl operations compared with a full quarter in the prior-year period. The current-year period also included a higher level of separation-related charges. These dynamics were partially offset by higher charges for structural actions in the prior-year period. The discontinued operations provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $66 million compared with $188 million in the prior-year period.

Operating (non-GAAP) earnings in 2020 were $6.1 billion, which also included the charge for workforce rebalancing. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.38 as reported and $6.82 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. On a consolidated basis, we also generated $18.1 billion in cash from operations, $10.8 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $5.8 billion in dividends. With the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainty beginning in March 2020, client priorities shifted to maintaining operational stability, flexibility and preservation of cash. While there was continued demand for offerings that support their digital transformation, clients moved to shorter term duration engagements and prioritized operational expenditures over capital expenditures, which impacted the companyÕs performance in 2020. However, our results reflected strong performance in hybrid cloud led by Red Hat, gross margin expansion and solid cash generation. We also continued to strengthen our position as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company through strategic organic investments and acquisitions.  \\nTotal revenue decreased 4.4 percent as reported and 4.5 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. To provide better transparency on the recurring performance of the ongoing business, total revenue, geographic revenue and hybrid cloud revenue growth rates are provided excluding divested businesses and at constant currency. These divested businesses are included in the category ÒOtherÑdivested businesses.Ó Excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency, revenue decreased 2.9 percent. Software revenue increased 2.3 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency, with strong performance from Red Hat, offset by declines in transactional performance in other areas of the portfolio. Software revenue performance was impacted by purchase deferrals, clients opting for shorter duration contracts and preference for operating expenses over capital expenditures. Consulting decreased 4.0 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency with declines due to project delays and less discretionary spending by clients. Infrastructure decreased 7.9 percent year to year as reported and 8 percent adjusted for currency primarily due to product cycle dynamics. Across the segments, total IBM hybrid cloud revenue of $16.8 billion in 2020 grew 22 percent as reported (21 percent adjusted for currency) and 24 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency. \\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas revenue declined 5.5 percent year to year as reported (3 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). EMEA decreased 3.0 percent (3 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific declined 3.7 percent (3 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). \\nThe gross margin of 55.9 percent increased 1.3 points year to year, and the operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 57.3 percent increased 1.7 points versus the prior year, reflecting portfolio mix with strong software contribution and our focus on productivity.  \\nTotal expense and other (income) increased 16.3 percent in 2020 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year performance was driven by higher charges for workforce rebalancing, a full year of Red Hat operational spending in 2020 compared to six months in 2019, lower gains from divestitures and higher non-operating retirement-related costs, partially offset by lower spending including reductions in travel and other expenses associated with COVID-19 restrictions. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 15.5 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors excluding the non-operating retirement-related costs.  \\nPre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.6 billion decreased 64.3 percent and the pre-tax margin was 4.7 percent, a decrease of 7.8 points versus 2019, primarily due to higher workforce rebalancing charges in 2020, lower gains from divestitures and higher retirement-related costs in the current year. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2020 was (52.9) percent compared to 0.8 percent in 2019. The benefit from income taxes in 2020 was primarily due to the tax impacts of an intra-entity sale of certain of the companyÕs intellectual property and related impacts in the first quarter, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion and a benefit of $0.2 billion related to a foreign tax law change. Net income from continuing operations of $3.9 billion decreased 45.0 percent and the net income from continuing operations margin was 7.1 percent, down 5.3 points year to year, primarily due to the fourth-quarter workforce rebalancing charge. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $5.5 billion decreased 42.1 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 6.5 points to 9.9 \\npercent, reflecting the higher workforce rebalancing charges and lower gains from divestitures in the current year. The operating (nonGAAP) effective tax rate for 2020 was (11.5) percent compared to 4.0 percent in 2019. The current year operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was primarily driven by the net tax benefit from an intra-entity IP sale in the first quarter. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $6.1 billion decreased 32.7 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 11.1 percent was down 4.7 points year to year.  \\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.38 in 2020 decreased 45.3 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $6.82 decreased 33.0 percent versus 2019, both including a ($1.33) impact from the structural actions initiated in the fourth-quarter 2020.  \\nDuring 2020, we continued to take actions to further enhance our balance sheet and liquidity position. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities at year end were $14.3 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion from December 31, 2019. Throughout 2020, we took mitigation actions to preserve liquidity as well as strategic actions to optimize our capital structure, for example, we re-focused our Financing portfolio reducing our external debt needs. We reduced total debt by $1.4 billion from year end 2019 and $11.7 billion since the second quarter of 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat transaction). \\nResults of Continuing Operations \\nAs discussed in the ÒOrganization of InformationÓ section, with the completion of the separation on November 3, 2021, results of Kyndryl are reported as discontinued operations. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation in the Management Discussion to allow for a meaningful comparison of continuing operations. \\nSegment Details \\nThe following is an analysis of the 2020 versus 2019 reportable segment results. The table below presents each reportable segmentÕs revenue and gross margin results. Segment pre-tax income includes certain limited transactions, predominantly between the Financing and Infrastructure segments, that are recorded to other income and excludes certain unallocated corporate items.

Results in 2020 include a full year of Red Hat revenue. \\nSoftware revenue of $22,927 million increased 2.3 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year. There was strong growth in Hybrid Platform & Solutions, driven primarily by Red Hat, as our hybrid cloud and AI solutions are resonating with clients. Transaction Processing revenue decreased year to year, driven by declines in transactional software performance as clients delayed longer term commitments in 2020 due to the macroeconomic environment. \\nHybrid Platform & Solutions revenue of $16,321 million increased 12.8 percent as reported (12 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven by a full year of Red Hat revenue contribution and Red HatÕs strong performance in infrastructure software and application development and emerging technologies. Red Hat OpenShift, the leading open source hybrid cloud platform, helped clients modernize mission-critical workloads, build cloud native applications, and deploy and manage data and applications across various clouds within an environment that is open, flexible and secure. Security revenue grew year to year due to good client adoption in security solutions such as Cloud Pak for Security and growth in security services as clients focused on their secure digital transformations. This growth was partially offset by year-to-year declines in Automation and Data & AI as clients deferred transformational investments in 2020 to focus on their core operations. \\nTransaction Processing revenue of $6,606 million decreased 16.8 percent as reported (17 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year. With the macroeconomic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, clients focused on near-term priorities resulting in purchase deferrals, which impacted our transactional software performance in 2020. However, our subscription and support revenue grew in 2020 compared to the prior year. \\nWithin Software, hybrid cloud revenue of $6.9 billion grew 69 percent as reported and 68 percent adjusted for currency year to year. \\n($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t   \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tYr.-to-Yr.   \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tPercent/   \\n                                               Margin   For the year ended December 31:      2020 * 2019 * Change  \\nSoftware \t \t  \t \t  \t \t \t \\nGross profit \t  \\n$ 17,958   \\n$ 17,470   \\n2.8 \\nGross profit margin \t \\n \t78.3  %   \\n \t78.0  %   \\n0.4 \\nPre-tax income \t  Pre-tax margin \t \\n$ 3,341    14.6  %   \\n$ 5,025    22.4  %   \\n(33.5) (7.8)\\n %  pts. \\n% \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t pts. \\n* Recast to reflect segment changes. \\nThe Software gross profit margin increased 0.4 points to 78.3 percent in 2020 compared to the prior year. The gross profit margin expansion was driven primarily by the full-year contribution from Red Hat and year-to-year improvement in services margins as we continued to focus on shifting to higher value services, such as Software-as-a-Service and security services, and driving AI-powered automation across the portfolio. Pre-tax income of $3,341 million decreased 33.5 percent compared to the prior year with a pre-tax margin decline of 7.8 points to 14.6 percent. The decline in pre-tax income and margin was driven primarily by the decline in transactional software performance in Transaction Processing and our continued investment in strategic areas of hybrid cloud and AI.

In 2020, we entered into arrangements to sell certain financing receivables to third parties. While the strategic actions we have taken are the primary driver of the decline in external revenue and pre-tax income on a year-to-year basis, our repositioning of the Financing business has strengthened our liquidity position, improved the quality of our portfolio and lowered our debt needs. \\nFinancing revenue decreased 19.8 percent (19 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven by commercial financing which declined $196 million to $45 million and client financing which declined $44 million to $930 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in financing revenue was due to a lower average asset balance, primarily driven by the strategic actions described above. \\nFinancing pre-tax income decreased 31.2 percent to $449 million compared to the prior year and the pre-tax margin of 46.1 percent decreased 7.6 points year to year. The decrease in pre-tax income was primarily driven by a decrease in gross profit reflecting the strategic actions described above, a decline in internal financing and higher provisions for credit losses in Americas.   \\nGeographic Revenue \\nIn addition to the revenue presentation by reportable segment, we also measure revenue performance on a geographic basis. \\n($ in millions) \\n \t  \t \\n\\n  \t \\n\\n \t \t \t \t \t \\n \\n \t \t \\n \\n \t \\n \\n\t \t \t \t \tYr.-to-Yr.   \\n \\n \t \t \\n \\n \t \\n \\n\t \t \t \t \tPercent Change   \\n \\n \t \t \\n \\n \t \\n \\n\t \t \tYr.-to-Yr.  \tExcluding Divested   \\n \\n \t \t \\n \\n \t \\n \\nYr.-to-Yr. \t Percent Change  \tBusinesses And   \\n \\n \t \t \\n \\n \t \\n \\nPercent \t \tAdjusted for  \tAdjusted for   \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n     \t2020  \\n\\n2019  \\n\\nChange      \tCurrency      \tCurrency  \\nTotal revenue \\n  $55,179   \\n\\n$57,714   \\n\\n\t(4.4)% \t(4.5)% \t(2.9)% \\nAmericas \\n  $27,119   \\n\\n$28,704   \\n\\n\t(5.5)% \t(4.5)% \t(2.8)% \\nEurope/Middle East/Africa \\n  16,767  \\n\\n 17,282   \\n\\n\t(3.0)  \t(4.5)  \t(2.8) \\n \tAsia Pacific \\n   11,293  \t \t  \\n\\n  11,728  \t   \\n\\n \t(3.7)   \t \t(4.5)   \t \t(3.4)  \\n \\nTotal revenue of $55,179 million in 2020 decreased 4.4 percent year to year as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency and 3 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). \\nAmericas revenue decreased 5.5 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency and 3 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency).

NMÐNot meaningful \\nTotal expense and other (income) year-to-year results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by the Red Hat acquisition which closed in July 2019. As a result, in 2020, there was a full year of expenses for Red Hat operational spending and amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the transaction. Expense in 2020 also included a fourth-quarter $1.5 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions (primarily workforce rebalancing) to simplify and optimize our operating model. \\nTotal expense and other (income) increased 16.3 percent in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher Red Hat operational spending, the fourth-quarter charge for workforce rebalancing, lower gains from divestitures and higher nonoperating retirement-related costs, partially offset by lower spending including reductions in travel and other expenses associated with COVID-19 restrictions. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 15.5 percent year to year, driven primarily by the factors above excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs. \\nTotal selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased 9.8 percent in 2020 versus 2019, driven primarily by the following factors: \\n¥ Higher workforce rebalancing charge (9 points);  \\n¥ Higher spending (1 point) driven by a full year of Red Hat operational expense in 2020 compared to six months in 2019 (6 points), partially offset by spending reductions associated with COVID-19 restrictions; \\n¥ Higher amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the Red Hat transaction (2 points); partially offset by  \\n¥ Lower acquisition-related charges associated with the Red Hat transaction (2 points). \\nProvisions for expected credit loss expense increased $45.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The receivables provision coverage was 2.2 percent at December 31, 2020, an increase of 70 basis points from December 31, 2019. The higher coverage rate at December 31, 2020 also reflects the adoption of the new guidance for current expected credit losses. \\nRD&E expense increased 5.9 percent in 2020 versus 2019 primarily driven by: \\n¥ Higher spending (7 points) driven by a full year of Red Hat spending in 2020 compared to six months in 2019 (8 points); partially offset by \\n¥ Lower acquisition-related charges associated with the Red Hat transaction (1 point). \\nTotal intellectual property and custom development income decreased 2.8 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. This was primarily due to a decline in licensing of intellectual property including royalty-based fees compared to the prior year. The timing and amount of licensing, sales or other transfers of IP may vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of licensing agreements, economic conditions, industry consolidation and the timing of new patents and know-how development. \\nTotal other (income) and expense was expense of $802 million in 2020 compared to income of $1,012 million in 2019. The year-toyear change was primarily driven by: \\n¥ Lower gains from divestitures ($733 million); \\n¥ Higher non-operating retirement-related costs ($497 million);  \\n¥ Net exchange losses (including derivative instruments) in the current year versus net exchange gains (including derivative instruments) in the prior year ($277 million); and \\n¥ Lower interest income ($244 million) driven by lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance in the current year. \\nInterest expense decreased $56 million compared to 2019. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Income Statement only if the related external borrowings are to support the Financing external business. Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) in 2020 was $1,738 million, a decrease of $214 million year to year, primarily driven by lower average interest rates.  \\nIncome Taxes \\nThe continuing operations effective tax rate for 2020 was (52.9) percent compared to 0.8 percent in 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion related to an intra-entity sale of certain of the companyÕs intellectual property and related impacts in the first quarter of 2020, and a benefit of $0.2 billion related to a foreign tax law change. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2020 was (11.5) percent compared to 4.0 percent in 2019. The 2020 operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was primarily driven by the net tax benefit from the intra-entity IP sale. For more information, see note H, ÒTaxes.Ó \\nResults of Discontinued Operations \\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax was $1,658 million in 2020 compared to $2,285 million in 2019, a decrease of 27.4 percent year to year. The decrease was primarily driven by charges for structural actions in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Our portfolio, our capital allocation and the actions we have been taking are all designed to Òcreate value through focusÓ for our clients, our partners, our employees and our shareholders.   \\nOur most significant portfolio action was the separation of Kyndryl which was completed on November 3. The separation of Kyndryl creates two industry-leading companies, which will continue to have a strong commercial relationship. Both IBM and Kyndryl have increased clarity and ability to focus on their respective operating and financial models, including capital deployment, investment strategies and investment grade capital structures. The separation enables greater freedom of action to partner and capture new opportunities.  \\nWe are building a stronger client-centric culture to drive growth. We have been aggressively hiring with approximately 60 percent of our hires in Consulting. We are scaling resources in garages, client engineering centers and customer success managers, to better serve our clients. We are increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas like quantum. We continue to acquire companies that complement and strengthen our portfolio, with a total of 15 acquisitions in 2021. We are increasing investment to expand our ecosystem to drive platform adoption and are simplifying and redesigning our go-to market to better meet client needs, and to execute on our growth agenda.  \\nWe are addressing the hybrid cloud and AI opportunity with a more platform-centric business model. Our new management structure, under our four reportable segments: Software, Consulting, Infrastructure and Financing, aligns our operating model to our platformcentric approach, reflects a simpler and more streamlined business and provides greater transparency into segment trends.  \\nOur platform-centric approach is designed to meet clients wherever they are in their digital transformation journey. The hybrid cloud platform we have built is open, secure, and flexible and continues to gain traction in the marketplace. We are seeing high demand for our capabilities in several areas. Across industries, clients see technology as a major source of competitive advantage and are eager to automate as many business tasks as possible. They realize that powerful technologies, embedded at the heart of their business, can lead to seismic shifts in the way they create value and differentiation. They are using AI and predictive capabilities to mitigate friction in their supply chains. Cybersecurity remains a major area of concern as the cost of cybercrime rises each year. As clients deal with these challenges and opportunities, they are looking for a partner they can trust and who has a proven track record in bringing about strategic transformation projects. There is tremendous opportunity for us to help our clients leverage the power of hybrid cloud and AI. This is what we have built our platform for and why we have such confidence in our strategy. \\nWith the actions we have taken to simplify our operating model, the fundamentals of our business model remain solid. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong. At December 31, 2021, we had $7.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. We have made good progress in deleveraging, while being acquisitive and without sacrificing investments in our business or our solid dividend policy. We have reduced our debt by $9.6 billion since the end of 2020 and $21.3 billion from our peak level at June 30, 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition).  \\nWe exited 2021 a different company. We have a higher growth and higher value business mix, with over 70 percent of our revenue in software and services, and a significant recurring revenue base, dominated by software. This will result in an improving revenue growth profile, higher operating margin, strong and growing free cash flow and lower capital intensity Ð leading to a higher return on invested capital business. We are managing for the long-term and are confident in the direction and focus of our business. We expect to continue our progress as a leading hybrid cloud and AI company with a focus on revenue growth and cash generation while maintaining a strong dividend policy. Our expectations for 2022 are aligned with our mid-term financial model which was previously communicated at our investor briefing on October 4, 2021. \\nRetirement-Related Plans \\nThe combination of modest returns and higher discount rates improved the overall funded status of our plans. In aggregate, our worldwide-tax qualified plans are funded at 107 percent, with the U.S. at 112 percent. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.1 billion in 2022, approximately flat compared to 2021, of which $0.2 billion generally relates to legally required contributions to non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans. We expect 2022 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.1 billion, a decrease of approximately $500 million compared to 2021. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2021. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion in 2022, a decrease of approximately $100 million versus 2021. Non-operating retirementrelated plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.9 billion, a decrease of approximately $400 million compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher income from expected return on assets and lower recognized actuarial losses.        \\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \\nThe company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds ranging between $12.8 billion and $18.2 billion per year over the past three years. The company provides for additional liquidity through several sources: maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to global funding sources, committed global credit facilities and other committed and uncommitted lines of credit worldwide. The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2019 through 2021. \\nCash Flow and Liquidity Trends \\n($ in billions) \t \\n  \t \\n  \t \\n  \\n \t     \\n2021      \\n2020      \\n2019 \\nNet cash from operating activities* \t  \\n$ 12.8  ** \\n$ 18.2   \\n$ 14.8  \\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities   \\n$ 7.6   \\n$ 14.3   \\n$ 9.0  \\nCommitted global credit facilities? \t  \\n \t \\n $  10.0    \\n $  15.3    \\n $  15.3  \\n*   Includes cash flows of discontinued operations of $1.6 billion, $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \\n** Includes 10 months of Kyndryl operations, and reflects cash paid in 2021 for separation charges and structural actions initiated in the fourth-quarter 2020.  \\n??See note Q, ÒBorrowings,Ó for additional information. \\nIn 2021, we continued to actively de-lever our debt, invested $3.3 billion in acquisitions and provided a growing dividend to our shareholders. \\nOn July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing.  \\nThe indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of IBMÕs consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. \\nWe are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable. \\nWe do not have Òratings triggerÓ provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBMÕs credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $162 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companyÕs outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. \\nThe major ratings agencies ratings on our debt securities at December 31, 2021 were as follows: \\n \t \t \t \t \\n\\n \t     \t \t     \tMoodyÕs  \t \tStandard \t \tInvestors \\nIBM Ratings \t and PoorÕs  Service Senior long-term debt \t  A-   A3 \\n\tCommercial paper  \t  \tA-2   \tPrime-2 \\nIBM has ample financial flexibility, supported by our strong liquidity position and cash flows, to operate at a single A credit rating. Debt levels have decreased $9.6 billion from December 31, 2020 and $21.3 billion from our peak levels at June 30, 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition).    \\nIn July 2017, the UK\\'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), had announced its intent to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In March 2021, the FCA extended the phase out in the case of U.S. dollar settings for certain tenors until the end of June 2023. During this time, various central bank committees and working groups addressed replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Effective December 31, 2021, the use of LIBOR has been substantially eliminated for purposes of any new financial contract executions. Any legacy USD LIBOR based financial contracts are expected to be addressed using the LIBOR rates published through the June 2023 extension period. We have evaluated the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management and internal operational readiness, and have monitored the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate. The replacement of the LIBOR benchmark within the companyÕs risk management activities did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.  \\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 65 and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 28. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format. \\nManagement uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and our Financing receivables are the basis for that growth. Accordingly, management considers Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Financing receivables. \\nThe following table represents the way in which management reviews cash flow as described below and is presented on a consolidated basis, including cash flows of discontinued operations. \\n($ in billions) \t \t  \t \t  \t \t  \t \\nFor the year ended December 31: \t     \\n2021      \\n2020      \\n2019 \\nNet cash from operating activities per GAAP* \t  \\n$ 12.8  \\n$ 18.2  \\n$ 14.8 \\nLess: the change in Financing receivables \t \\n \t3.9  \\n \t4.3  \\n \t0.5 \\nNet cash from operating activities, excluding Financing receivables \t \\n \t8.9  \\n 13.8  \\n \t14.3 \\nCapital expenditures, net \t \\n \t(2.4) \\n \t(3.0) \\n \t(2.4)\\nFree cash flow (FCF) \t \\n \t6.5  ** \\n 10.8  \\n \t11.9 \\nAcquisitions \t \\n \t(3.3) \\n \t(0.3) \\n (32.6)\\nDivestitures \t \\n \t0.1  \\n \t0.5  \\n \t1.1 \\nShare repurchase \t \\n \tÑ  \\n \tÑ  \\n \t(1.4)\\nCommon stock repurchases for tax withholdings \t \\n \t(0.3) \\n \t(0.3) \\n \t(0.3)\\nDividends \t \\n \t(5.9) \\n \t(5.8) \\n \t(5.7)\\nNon-Financing debt \t \\n \t(1.2) \\n \t0.2  \\n \t22.8 \\nOther (includes Financing receivables and Financing debt) \t \\n \t(2.7)??\\n \t0.2  \\n \t1.0 \\nChange in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term \t  marketable securities \\n$ (6.7) \\n$\t5.3  \\n$ (3.2)\\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n*   Includes cash flows of discontinued operations of $1.6 billion, $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \\n** Includes cash impacts of approximately $1.4 billion for Kyndryl-related structural actions and separation charges. \\n?  Includes the distribution from Kyndryl of $0.9 billion.   \\n \\nFrom the perspective of how management views cash flow, in 2021, after investing $2.4 billion in capital investments, we generated free cash flow of $6.5 billion. These consolidated results include 10 months of Kyndryl operations, and reflect cash paid in 2021 for separation charges and structural actions initiated in the fourth-quarter 2020. Payments made in 2021 for prior-year taxes that were deferred in relation to COVID-19 government relief programs also contributed to the year-to-year decline. In 2021, we continued to return value to shareholders including $5.9 billion in dividends.  \\nIBMÕs Board of Directors considers the dividend payment on a quarterly basis. In the second quarter of 2021, the Board of Directors increased the companyÕs quarterly common stock dividend from $1.63 to $1.64 per share. \\nEvents that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note S, ÒCommitments & Contingencies.Ó With respect to pension funding, in 2021, we contributed $103 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans compared to $189 million in 2020. As highlighted in the Contractual Obligations table, we expect to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $1.1 billion in the next five years. The 2022 contributions are currently expected to be approximately $200 million. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.1 billion in 2022, approximately flat compared to 2021. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. We are not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations. \\nIn 2022, we are not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. \\nOur cash flows are sufficient to fund our current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. When additional requirements arise, we have several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing our committed global credit facilities. With our share repurchase program suspended since the close of the Red Hat acquisition, our overall shareholder payout remains at a comfortable level and we remain fully committed to our long-standing dividend policy. \\nContractual Obligations \\n\t($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t  \t \t  \t \t  \t \t \t \\n \t     \\n \t     \\nTotal Contractual \t Payment Stream      \\n\\nPayments Due In \\n\\n\\n\\n\t2022 \t     \\n2023Ð24 \t     \\n2025Ð26 \\n     After 2026 \\nLong-term debt obligations \t \\n$ 52,240  \\n$ 6,729  \\n$11,204  \\n$ 8,726  \\n$25,581 \\nInterest on long-term debt obligations \t \\n 15,252  \\n \t1,478  \\n \t2,617  \\n \t1,837  \\n9,320 \\nFinance lease obligations* \t \\n\t \t99  \\n \t36  \\n \t35  \\n \t7  \\n20 \\nOperating lease obligations* \t \\n 3,669  \\n \t1,047  \\n \t1,530  \\n \t737  \\n356 \\nPurchase obligations \t \\nOther long-term liabilities: \t \\n 2,959  \\n \t \\n \t854  \\n \t \\n \t1,447  \\n \t \\n \t643  \\n \t \\n15 \\nMinimum defined benefit plan pension funding \\n\t(mandated)** \t \\n 1,100  \\n \t200  \\n \t500  \\n \t400  \\n\\n\tExcess 401(k) Plus Plan \t \\n 1,892  \\n \t206  \\n \t455  \\n \t511  \\n720 \\n\tLong-term termination benefits \t \\n 1,388  \\n \t539  \\n \t229  \\n \t135  \\n485 \\n\tTax reserves? \t \\n 5,311  \\n \t37  \\n \t \\n \t \\n\\n\tOther \t \t \t612  \t \t131  \t \t172  \t \t52  \t258  \\n\tTotal \t \t$ 84,522  \t$ 11,257  \t$18,189  \t$ 13,048  \t$36,755  \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n* Finance lease obligations are presented on a discounted cash flow basis, whereas operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted cash flow basis. \\n** As funded status on plans will vary, obligations for mandated minimum pension payments after 2026 could not be reasonably estimated. \\n? These amounts represent the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that approximately $37 million of the liability is expected to be settled within the next 12 months. The settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the income tax liability cannot be reasonably estimated as the timing of the payments will depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various tax authorities; however, it is not expected to be due within the next 12 months. \\nCertain contractual obligations reported in the previous table exclude the effects of time value and therefore, may not equal the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Certain noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the previous table as their future cash outflows are uncertain. This includes deferred taxes, derivatives, deferred income, disability benefits and other sundry items. Certain obligations related to our divestitures are included. \\nPurchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services (take-or-pay). If the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract is included in the previous table. If the obligation is cancelable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, the dollar amount of the penalty is included as a purchase obligation. Contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment. \\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts that specify that we will purchase all or a portion of our requirements of a specific product, commodity or service from a supplier or vendor. These contracts are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms. They do not specify fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and, therefore, we do not consider them to be purchase obligations. \\nInterest on floating-rate debt obligations is calculated using the effective interest rate at December 31, 2021, plus the interest rate spread associated with that debt, if any. \\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \\nFrom time to time, we may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by SEC Financial Reporting Release 67 (FRR-67), ÒDisclosure in ManagementÕs Discussion and Analysis about Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations.Ó \\nAt December 31, 2021, we had no such off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See the table above for our contractual obligations, and note S, ÒCommitments & Contingencies,Ó for detailed information about our guarantees, financial commitments and indemnification arrangements. We do not have retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or other material off-balance sheet interests or instruments. \\nCritical Accounting Estimates \\nThe application of GAAP requires IBM to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to IBMÕs financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of IBMÕs Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies are described in note A, ÒSignificant Accounting Policies.Ó \\nThe macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our critical accounting estimates reflected in our 2020 and 2021 results. Given the inherent uncertainty of the magnitude of future impacts from and/or the duration of the pandemic, our estimates may change materially in future periods. \\nA quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity (e.g., 1 percent, 10 percent, etc.) are included to allow users of the Annual Report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent managementÕs predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment. \\nPension Assumptions \\nFor our defined benefit pension plans, the measurement of the benefit obligation to plan participants and net periodic pension (income)/cost requires the use of certain assumptions, including, among others, estimates of discount rates and expected return on plan assets. \\nChanges in the discount rate assumptions would impact the (gain)/loss amortization and interest cost components of the net periodic pension (income)/cost calculation and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The discount rate assumption for the IBM Personal Pension Plan (PPP), a U.S.-based defined benefit plan, increased by 40 basis points to 2.60 percent on December 31, 2021. This change will decrease pre-tax income recognized in 2022 by an estimated $33 million. If the discount rate assumption for the PPP had decreased by 40 basis points on December 31, 2021, pre-tax income recognized in 2022 would increase by an estimated $43 million. Further changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the PBO which, in turn, may impact our funding decisions if the PBO exceeds plan assets. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would cause a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, in the PPPÕs PBO of an estimated $1.1 billion based upon December 31, 2021 data. \\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets assumption is used in calculating the net periodic pension (income)/cost. Expected returns on plan assets are calculated based on the market-related value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets systematically over a five-year period in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized over five years in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost and also as a component of actuarial (gains)/losses, which are recognized over the service lives or life expectancy of the participants, depending on the plan, provided such amounts exceed thresholds which are based upon the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets, as provided by accounting standards. \\nTo the extent the outlook for long-term returns changes such that management changes its expected long-term return on plan assets assumption, each 50 basis point change in the expected long-term return on PPP plan assets assumption would have an estimated impact of $238 million on the following yearÕs pre-tax net periodic pension (income)/cost (based upon the PPPÕs plan assets at December 31, 2021 and assuming no contributions are made in 2022). \\nWe may voluntarily make contributions or be required, by law, to make contributions to our pension plans. Actual results that differ from the estimates may result in more or less future IBM funding into the pension plans than is planned by management. Impacts of these types of changes on our pension plans in other countries worldwide would vary depending upon the status of each respective plan. \\nIn addition to the above, we evaluate other pension assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age and mortality, and update these assumptions to reflect experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year can differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. \\nFor additional information on our pension plans and the development of these assumptions, see note W, ÒRetirement-Related Benefits.Ó \\nRevenue Recognition \\nApplication of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations. Other significant judgments include determining whether IBM or a reseller is acting as the principal in a transaction and whether separate contracts should be combined and considered part of one arrangement. \\nRevenue recognition is also impacted by our ability to determine when a contract is probable of collection and to estimate variable consideration, including, for example, rebates, volume discounts, service-level penalties and performance bonuses. We consider various factors when making these judgments, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience and market and economic conditions. Evaluations are conducted each quarter to assess the adequacy of the estimates. If the estimates were changed by 10 percent in 2021, the impact on net income would have been $42 million. \\nCosts to Complete Service Contracts \\nWe enter into numerous service contracts through our services businesses. During the contractual period, revenue, cost and profits may be impacted by estimates of the ultimate profitability of each contract, especially contracts for which we use cost-to-cost measures of progress. If at any time these estimates indicate the contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately in cost. We perform ongoing profitability analyses of these services contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates require updating. Key factors reviewed to estimate the future costs to complete each contract are future labor costs and product costs and expected productivity efficiencies. Contract loss provisions recorded as a component of other accrued expenses and liabilities were immaterial at December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\nIncome Taxes \\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes. \\nDuring the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. To the extent that new information becomes available which causes us to change our judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities, such changes to tax liabilities will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. \\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies/actions. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. \\nThe consolidated provision for income taxes will change period to period based on nonrecurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies. \\nTo the extent that the provision for income taxes increases/decreases by 1 percent of income from continuing operations before income taxes, consolidated net income would have decreased/improved by $48 million in 2021. \\nValuation of Assets \\nThe application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired including separately identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of managementÕs assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. \\nValuation of Goodwill \\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We may elect to first assess qualitative risk factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include entity specific factors, industry and market conditions, legal and regulatory actions, as well as other individual factors impacting each reporting unit such as loss of key personnel and overall financial performance. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. \\nIn the quantitative test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach. When circumstances warrant, we may also use a combination of the income approach and certain market approaches. \\nUnder the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated discounted future cash flows. The discounted cash flow methodology includes the use of projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth rates, gross margins, discount rates, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. \\nWe perform the annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter. In fourth-quarter 2021, as a result of the separation of Kyndryl that occurred on November 3, 2021 and the segment changes immediately prior to the separation, we performed the quantitative test for goodwill impairment for all reporting units.  \\nWhen estimating the fair value of the Infrastructure Services reporting unit, which included Kyndryl, we applied a weighted average approach utilizing a combination of income and market approaches. Under the market approaches, we estimated the fair value through consideration of market multiples of comparable companies and the market capitalization of Kyndryl. We applied a control premium to these market approaches, which was estimated primarily through consideration of market data for recent comparable transactions. The income approach was used to estimate the fair value of all other reporting units. \\nThe quantitative assessments resulted in no impairment as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. The Infrastructure Services reporting unit, which contained the future Kyndryl reporting unit and had goodwill of $5.8 billion as of the time of testing, exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 8 percent. Each of the other reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Following the changes to the organizational structure, goodwill was reassigned to the new reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach. As a result, we performed the quantitative test for goodwill impairment for all affected reporting units. The quantitative assessment resulted in no impairment. Goodwill applicable to the Kyndryl business of $5.8 billion was allocated to the Kyndryl reporting unit and was derecognized at the time of the separation. Each of the other reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value. \\nLoss Contingencies \\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation, and may revise our estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. \\nFinancing Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses \\nThe Financing business reviews its financing receivables portfolio on a regular basis in order to assess collectibility and records adjustments to the allowance for credit losses at least quarterly. A description of the methods used by management to estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables is included in note A, ÒSignificant Accounting Policies.Ó Factors that could result in actual receivable losses that are materially different from the estimated reserve include significant changes in the economy, or a sudden change in the economic health of a significant client that represents a concentration in FinancingÕs receivables portfolio. \\nTo the extent that actual collectibility differs from managementÕs estimates currently provided for by 10 percent, FinancingÕs segment pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes would be higher or lower by an estimated $20 million depending upon whether the actual collectibility was better or worse, respectively, than the estimates. \\nResidual Value \\nResidual value represents the estimated fair value of equipment under lease as of the end of the lease. Residual value estimates can impact the determination of whether a lease is classified as operating, sales-type or direct financing. Financing estimates the future fair value of leased equipment by using historical models, analyzing the current market for new and used equipment, and obtaining forward-looking product information such as marketing plans and technological innovations. Residual value estimates are periodically reviewed and Òother than temporaryÓ declines in estimated future residual values are recognized upon identification. Anticipated increases in future residual values are not recognized until the equipment is remarketed. \\nFactors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimates include significant changes in the used-equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. \\nTo the extent that actual residual value recovery is lower than managementÕs estimates by 10 percent, FinancingÕs segment pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2021 would have been lower by an estimated $35 million. If the actual residual value recovery is higher than managementÕs estimates, the increase in income will be realized at the end of lease when the equipment is remarketed. \\nCurrency Rate Fluctuations \\nChanges in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results and financial position. At December 31, 2021, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2020. We use financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions. \\nDuring periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, we may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve our position competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to our customers. Competition will frequently take the same action. Consequently, we believe that some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to clients. We also maintain currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which may temporarily mitigate, but not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on our financial results. \\nWe translate revenue, cost and expense in our non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to Òadjusted for currencyÓ or Òconstant currencyÓ reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that we utilize to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted our year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in 2021. Based on the currency rate movements in 2021, total revenue increased 3.9 percent as reported and 2.7 percent at constant currency versus 2020. On an income from continuing operations before income taxes basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $70 million in 2021 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $100 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $260 million in 2020 on an as-reported and on an operating (nonGAAP) basis. We view these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to our as-reported financial results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but we believe it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace. \\nFor non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, we manage currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. \\nMarket Risk \\nIn the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. In addition to the market risk associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, other examples of risk include collectibility of accounts receivable and recoverability of residual values on leased assets. \\nWe regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures. As a result, we do not anticipate any material losses from these risks. \\nOur debt, in support of the Financing business and the geographic breadth of our operations, contains an element of market risk from changes in interest and currency rates. We manage this risk, in part, through the use of a variety of financial instruments including derivatives, as described in note U, ÒDerivative Financial Instruments.Ó \\nTo meet disclosure requirements, we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our debt and other financial instruments. \\nThe financial instruments that are included in the sensitivity analysis are comprised of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, short-term and long-term loans, commercial financing and installment payment receivables, investments, long-term and short-term debt and derivative financial instruments. Our derivative financial instruments generally include interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward contracts. \\nTo perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market-sensitive instruments. The market values for interest and foreign currency exchange risk are computed based on the present value of future cash flows as affected by the changes in rates that are attributable to the market risk being measured. The discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The differences in this comparison are the hypothetical losses associated with each type of risk. \\nInformation provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that we would incur under normal market conditions because, due to practical limitations, all variables other than the specific market risk factor are held constant. In addition, the results of the model are constrained by the fact that certain items are specifically excluded from the analysis, while the financial instruments relating to the financing or hedging of those items are included by definition. Excluded items include short-term and long-term receivables from sales-type and direct financing leases, forecasted foreign currency cash flows and the companyÕs net investment in foreign operations. As a consequence, reported changes in the values of some of the financial instruments impacting the results of the sensitivity analysis are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge. \\nThe results of the sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows: \\nInterest Rate Risk \\nA hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the levels of interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of approximately $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. \\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk \\nA hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The theoretical changes from the prior year are primarily driven by changes in foreign currency activities related to IBM Financing, as well as long-term debt and derivatives. \\nFinancing Risks \\nSee the ÒDescription of BusinessÓ on page 15 for a discussion of the financing risks associated with the Financing business and managementÕs actions to mitigate such risks. \\nCybersecurity \\nWhile cybersecurity risk can never be completely eliminated, our approach draws on the depth and breadth of our global capabilities, both in terms of our offerings to clients and our internal approaches to risk management. We offer commercial security solutions that deliver capabilities in areas such as identity and access management, data security, application security, network security and endpoint security. These solutions include pervasive encryption, threat intelligence, analytics, cognitive and artificial intelligence, and forensic capabilities that analyze client security events, yielding insights about attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities facing the client. We also offer professional consulting and technical services solutions for security from assessment and incident response to deployment and resource augmentation. In addition, we offer managed and outsourced security solutions from multiple security operations centers around the world. Finally, security is embedded in a multitude of our products and offerings through secure engineering and operations, and by critical functions (e.g., encryption, access control) in servers, storage, software, services, and other solutions. \\nFrom an enterprise perspective, we implement a multi-faceted risk-management approach based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework to identify and address cybersecurity risks. In addition, we have established policies and procedures that provide the foundation upon which IBMÕs infrastructure and data are managed. We regularly assess and adjust our technical controls and methods to identify and mitigate emerging cybersecurity risks. We use a layered approach with overlapping controls to defend against cybersecurity attacks and threats on networks, end-user devices, servers, applications, data and cloud solutions. We draw heavily on our own commercial security solutions and services to mitigate cybersecurity risks. We also have threat intelligence and security monitoring programs, as well as a global incident response process to respond to cybersecurity threats and attacks. In addition, we utilize a combination of online training, educational tools, videos and other awareness initiatives to foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility among our workforce. \\nFINANCING \\nFinancing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Financing facilitates IBM clients\\' acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating solid returns on equity. \\nResults of Operations \\n \\n($ in millions) \\n\\n \\n\\n  \t \\n\\n  \t \\n\\n \t \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \t \\n \\n \t \\n \\nYr.-to-Yr.   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \t \\n \\n \t \\n \\nPercent   \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n\\n     \\n\\n2021      \\n\\n2020 * \\n\\nChange  \\nRevenue \\n\\n  \\n\\n$774   \\n\\n$975  \\n\\n (20.6)% \\nPre-tax income \\n \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n$441   \\n \t \t \\n\\n$449  \\n \t \t \\n\\n \t (1.8) % \\n* Recast to conform to 2021 presentation. \\nWe have refocused our Financing business on IBMÕs products and services. The wind down of our OEM commercial financing operations completed in early 2021. In 2020, we began entering into agreements to sell certain financing receivables to third parties. While these strategic actions impact revenue and pre-tax income on a year-to-year basis, our repositioning of the Financing business has strengthened our liquidity position, improved the quality of our portfolio, and lowered our debt needs. \\nFinancing revenue decreased 20.6 percent (22 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven by client financing down $166 million to $763 million and commercial financing down $35 million to $10 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in financing revenue was due to a lower average asset balance, driven by the strategic actions described above. \\nFinancing pre-tax income decreased 1.8 percent to $441 million compared to the prior year and the pre-tax margin of 57.0 percent increased 10.9 points year to year. The decrease in pre-tax income was primarily driven by a decrease in gross profit which reflects the strategic actions described above, partially offset by improvements in provisions for credit losses due to the overall improvement in the credit quality of our portfolio year to year, as well as lower future funding commitments reserves related to the separation of Kyndryl.

Approximately 67 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment-grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers, an increase of 6 points year to year and an increase of 1 point compared to September 30, 2021. This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio and reflects mitigating credit enhancement actions taken by the client to reduce the risk to IBM. \\nWe have a long-standing practice of taking mitigation actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties. These actions may include credit insurance, financial guarantees, nonrecourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Sale of receivables arrangements are also utilized in the normal course of business as part of our cash and liquidity management.  \\nThe company has entered into agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its client and commercial financing receivables for cash proceeds. Sales of client financing receivables include both loan and lease receivables. In addition, on December 24, 2020, the company entered into an agreement with a third-party investor to sell up to $3.0 billion of IBM short-term commercial financing receivables, at any one time, on a revolving basis, starting in the U.S. and Canada in 2020, and expanding to other countries within Europe and Asia Pacific in 2021, including Germany and the UK. \\nThe following table presents the total amount of client and commercial financing receivables transferred: \\n($ in millions) \t     \t \t     \t    \t \\n \t \\nClient financing receivables for the year ended December 31 \t \t \\n2021  \\n \\n2020 \\n\tLease receivables \t \\n$\t819  \\n$1,152 \\n\tLoan receivables \t \\n 2,224  \\n 1,410 \\nTotal client financing receivables transferred* \t \\nCommercial financing receivables \t \\n$3,043  \\n \\n$2,562 \\nReceivables transferred for the year ended December 31 \t Receivables transferred and uncollected as of December 31** \t \\n$7,359  1,653  \\n$\t515 \\n510 \\n*   More than half of the client financing receivables sold were classified as current assets at the time of sale. \\n** Of the total amount of commercial financing receivables sold and derecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the amounts presented remained uncollected from business partners as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\nFor additional information relating to financing receivables refer to note L, ÒFinancing Receivables.Ó Refer to pages 26 through 28 for additional information related to Financing segment receivables, allowance for credit losses and debt. \\n \\nReturn on Equity Calculation \\n($ in millions) \\n \\n \t \\n \\n \t \t  \\nAt December 31: \\n     \\n2021      \\n\\n2020 * \\nNumerator \\n \\n  \t \\n\\n  \t \\nFinancing after-tax income (1) ** \\n  \\n$ 374   \\n\\n$\t381  \\nDenominator \\n \\n \t \\n\\n \t \\nAverage Financing equity (2) ? \\n  \\n$ 1,935   \\n\\n$2,467  \\nFinancing return on equity  \t(1)/(2) \\n  \\n   19.3   % \\n\\n   15.4   % \\n* Recast to reflect segment changes. \\n** Calculated based upon an estimated tax rate principally based on FinancingÕs geographic mix of earnings as IBMÕs provision for income taxes is determined on a consolidated basis. \\n+ Average of the ending equity for Financing for the last five quarters. \\nReturn on equity was 19.3 percent compared to 15.4 percent for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase was driven by a lower average equity balance, which reflects the strategic actions and the overall improvement in the credit quality of our portfolio described in the Financing\\'s \\\"Results of OperationsÓ and \\\"Financial Position\\\" above. \\nResidual Value \\nResidual value is a risk unique to the financing business, and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for IBM products. Based upon this product information, Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio. \\nFinancing optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients or extending lease arrangements with current clients. \\nThe following table presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for sales-type and direct financing leases, as well as operating leases at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In addition, the table presents the run out of when the unguaranteed residual value assigned to equipment on leases at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, is expected to be returned to the company. \\nUnguaranteed Residual Value \\n\t($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t  \t \t  \t \t  \t \t \t \\n\t \t \tEstimated Run Out of December 31, 2021 Balance \\n \t At December 31, \tAt December 31, \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t2025  \t     \t2020 \t2021 \t2022 \t2023 \t2024 \t     and Beyond \\n\tSales-type and direct financing leases \t \t$469  \t$335  \t$ 99  \t$ 126  \t$65  \t$ 45  \\n\tOperating leases \t \t \t48  \t13  \t \t9  \t \t2  \t0  \t \t2  \\n\tTotal unguaranteed residual value  \t  \t$516  \t$348  \t$ 108  \t$ 128  \t$65  \t$ 47  \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nReport of Management  \\nManagement Responsibility for Financial Information \\nResponsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information presented in this Annual Report rests with IBM management. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, applying certain estimates and judgments as required. \\nIBM maintains an effective internal control structure. It consists, in part, of organizational arrangements with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority, and comprehensive systems and control procedures. An important element of the control environment is an ongoing internal audit program. Our system also contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. \\nTo assure the effective administration of internal controls, we carefully select and train our employees, develop and disseminate written policies and procedures, provide appropriate communication channels and foster an environment conducive to the effective functioning of controls. We believe that it is essential for the company to conduct its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards, as set forth in the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines. These guidelines, translated into numerous languages, are distributed to employees throughout the world, and reemphasized through internal programs to assure that they are understood and followed. \\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of independent, non-management directors, and is responsible for recommending to the Board the independent registered public accounting firm to be retained for the coming year, subject to stockholder ratification. The Audit Committee meets regularly and privately with the independent registered public accounting firm, with the companyÕs internal auditors, as well as with IBM management, to review accounting, auditing, internal control structure and financial reporting matters. \\nManagementÕs Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \\nThe companyÕs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companyÕs assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal ControlÐIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the companyÕs internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. \\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, is retained to audit IBMÕs Consolidated Financial Statements and the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. Its accompanying report is based on audits conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). \\n \t Arvind Krishna \t Chairman and Chief Executive Officer \t \\nFebruary 22, 2022 \t \\n \\n \t James J. Kavanaugh \t Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  \t \\nFebruary 22, 2022 \t \\n  \\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \\nInternational Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies \\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of International Business Machines Corporation \\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (the ÒCompanyÓ) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the Òconsolidated financial statementsÓ). We also have audited the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \\nBasis for Opinions \\n \\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying ManagementÕs Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the CompanyÕs consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  \\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \\n \\nA companyÕs internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companyÕs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companyÕs assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\nCritical Audit Matters \\n \\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \\nInternational Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies \\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \\nIncome TaxesÐUncertain Tax Positions \\n \\nAs described in Notes A and H to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As disclosed by management, during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, management recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. As further described by management, these tax liabilities are recognized when, despite managementÕs belief that the tax return positions are supportable, management believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Management bases its assessment of the accruals for tax liabilities on many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. As of December 31, 2021, unrecognized tax benefits were $8.7 billion.  \\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when estimating the uncertain tax positions, including applying complex tax laws, and a high degree of estimation uncertainty based on potential for significant adjustments as a result of audits by tax authorities or other forms of tax settlement. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort, and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate managementÕs timely identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Also, the evaluation of audit evidence available to support the uncertain tax positions is complex and required significant auditor judgment as the nature of the evidence is often inherently subjective, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of the uncertain tax positions, and controls addressing completeness of the uncertain tax positions, as well as controls over measurement of the amount recorded. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the information used in the calculation of the uncertain tax positions, including intercompany agreements, international, federal, and state filing positions, and the related final tax returns; (ii) testing the calculation of the uncertain tax positions by jurisdiction, including managementÕs assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefit expected to be sustained; (iii) testing the completeness of managementÕs assessment of both the identification of uncertain tax positions and possible outcomes of each uncertain tax position; and (iv) evaluating the status and results of income tax audits pending in various tax jurisdictions. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the completeness and measurement of the CompanyÕs uncertain tax positions, including evaluating the reasonableness of managementÕs assessment of whether tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained and the amount of potential benefit to be realized.  \\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment for the Infrastructure Services Reporting Unit \\n \\nAs described in Notes A and O to the consolidated financial statements, the CompanyÕs consolidated goodwill balance was $55.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter and whenever changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below an operating segment. As disclosed by management, if a quantitative test is performed, management compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. In the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the separation of Kyndryl and the segment changes immediately prior to the separation, management performed a quantitative test for goodwill impairment. Goodwill associated with the Infrastructure Services (IS) reporting unit was $5.8 billion as of the time of testing. Management estimated fair value based on a weighted average approach utilizing a combination of income and market approaches. Under the market approaches, management estimated the fair value through consideration of market multiples of comparable companies and market capitalization. Management applied a control premium to these market approaches. Under the income approach, management estimated the fair value based on the present value of estimated discounted future cash flows, which require the use of significant assumptions, including revenue growth rates and discount rates.  \\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment for the IS reporting unit is a critical audit matter are  the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the reporting unit, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managementÕs significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates and the discount rate used in the income approach, and the selection of market multiples of comparable companies and the control premium, as applicable, for the market approaches. Also, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managementÕs goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the IS reporting unit. These procedures also included, among Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \\nInternational Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies \\nothers, (i) testing managementÕs process for developing the fair value estimate, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches and the weighting of the approaches; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the income and market approaches; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates and the discount rate in the income approach and market multiples of comparable companies and the control premium, as applicable, in the market approaches. Evaluating managementÕs assumptions related to revenue growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the consistency with external market and industry data, (ii) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the income and market approaches, the weighting of the approaches, and evaluating the appropriateness of the discount rate, control premium, and market multiples of comparable companies assumptions. \\n \\n \t PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \t \\nNew York, New York \t  February 22, 2022 \t \\nWe, or firms that we have ultimately acquired, have served as the CompanyÕs auditor since 1923. For the period from 1923 to 1958, the Company was audited by firms that a predecessor firm to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ultimately acquired. \\n \\n\\nConsolidated Income Statement \\n \\n \\nFor the

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nBasis of Presentation \\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes of the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). \\nWithin the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This is annotated where applicable. \\nOn November 3, 2021, the company completed the previously announced separation of its managed infrastructure services unit into a new public company with the distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. (Kyndryl) to IBM stockholders on a pro rata basis. To effect the separation, IBM stockholders received one share of Kyndryl common stock for every five shares of IBM common stock held at the close of business on October 25, 2021, the record date for the distribution. The company retained 19.9 percent of the shares of Kyndryl common stock immediately following the separation with the intent to dispose of such shares within twelve months after the distribution. The company accounts for the retained Kyndryl common stock as a fair value investment included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with subsequent fair value changes included in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Refer to note J, ÒFinancial Assets and Liabilities,Ó for additional information.  \\nThe accounting requirements for reporting the separation of Kyndryl as a discontinued operation were met when the separation was completed. Accordingly, the historical results of Kyndryl are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Refer to note C, ÒSeparation of Kyndryl,Ó for additional information. \\nEffective immediately prior to the separation of Kyndryl, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system. These changes impacted the companyÕs reportable segments beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 but did not impact the companyÕs Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to note E, ÒSegments,Ó for additional information on the companyÕs reportable segments. The segments presented in this Annual Report are reported on a comparable basis for all periods. \\nOn July 9, 2019, the company completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Red Hat, Inc. (Red Hat). Refer to note F, ÒAcquisitions & Divestitures,Ó for additional information. \\nThe benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes the tax impacts of an intra-entity sale of certain of the companyÕs intellectual property, which resulted in a net benefit of $0.9 billion in the first quarter of 2020 and a benefit of $0.2 billion related to a foreign tax law change. Refer to note H, ÒTaxes,Ó for additional information. \\nNoncontrolling interest amounts of $19 million, $13 million and $16 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nPrinciples of Consolidation \\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of IBM and its controlled subsidiaries, which are primarily majority owned. Any noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary is reported as a component of total equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest is reported as described above in the Consolidated Income Statement. The accounts of variable interest entities (VIEs) are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, if required. Investments in business entities in which the company does not have control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method and the companyÕs proportionate share of income or loss is recorded in other (income) and expense. The accounting policy for other investments in equity securities is described within the ÒMarketable SecuritiesÓ section of this note. Equity investments in non-publicly traded entities lacking controlling financial interest or significant influence are primarily measured at cost, absent other indicators of fair value, net of impairment, if any. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. \\nUse of Estimates \\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Estimates are made for the following, among others: revenue, costs to complete service contracts, income taxes, pension assumptions, valuation of assets including goodwill and intangible assets, loss contingencies, allowance for credit losses and other matters. These estimates are based on managementÕs best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including the macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual results may be different from these estimates. \\nRevenue \\nThe company accounts for a contract with a client when it has written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection. \\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service transfers to a client, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the company estimates the amount to which it expects to be entitled using either the expected value or most likely amount method. The companyÕs contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price, including, for example, rebates, volume discounts, service-level penalties, and performance bonuses or other forms of contingent revenue. \\nThe company only includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The company may not be able to reliably estimate contingent revenue in certain long-term arrangements due to uncertainties that are not expected to be resolved for a long period of time or when the companyÕs experience with similar types of contracts is limited. The companyÕs arrangements infrequently include contingent revenue. Changes in estimates of variable consideration are included in note D, ÒRevenue \\nRecognition.Ó \\nThe companyÕs standard billing terms are that payment is due upon receipt of invoice, payable within 30 days. Invoices are generally issued as control transfers and/or as services are rendered. Additionally, in determining the transaction price, the company adjusts the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the billing terms are not standard and the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract provide the client or the company with a significant benefit of financing, in which case the contract contains a significant financing component. As a practical expedient, the company does not account for significant financing components if the period between when the company transfers the promised product or service to the client and when the client pays for that product or service will be one year or less. Most arrangements that contain a financing component are financed through the companyÕs Financing business and include explicit financing terms. \\nThe company may include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the company is acting as an agent between the client and the vendor, and gross when the company is the principal for the transaction. To determine whether the company is an agent or principal, the company considers whether it obtains control of the products or services before they are transferred to the customer. In making this evaluation, several factors are considered, most notably whether the company has primary responsibility for fulfillment to the client, as well as inventory risk and pricing discretion. \\nThe company recognizes revenue on sales to solution providers, resellers and distributors (herein referred to as resellers) when the reseller has economic substance apart from the company and the reseller is considered the principal for the transaction with the enduser client. \\nThe company reports revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. \\nIn addition to the aforementioned general policies, the following are the specific revenue recognition policies for arrangements with multiple performance obligations and for each major category of revenue. \\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations \\nThe companyÕs global capabilities as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company include services, software, hardware and related financing. The company enters into revenue arrangements that may consist of any combination of these products and services based on the needs of its clients. \\nThe company continues to develop new products and offerings and their associated consumption and delivery methods, including the use of cloud and as-a-Service models. These are not separate businesses; they are offerings across the segments that address market opportunities in areas such as analytics, data, cloud and security. Revenue from these offerings follows the specific revenue recognition policies for arrangements with multiple performance obligations and for each major category of revenue, depending on the type of offering, which are comprised of services, software and/or hardware. \\nTo the extent that a product or service in multiple performance obligation arrangements is subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance, that product or service is accounted for in accordance with such specific guidance. For all other products or services in these arrangements, the company determines if the products or services are distinct and allocates the consideration to each distinct performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. \\nWhen products and services are not distinct, the company determines an appropriate measure of progress based on the nature of its overall promise for the single performance obligation. \\nThe revenue policies in the Services, Hardware and/or Software sections below are applied to each performance obligation, as applicable. \\nServices \\nThe companyÕs primary services offerings include consulting services, including business transformation; technology consulting and application operations including the design and development of complex IT environments to a clientÕs specifications (e.g., design and build); cloud services; business process outsourcing; and infrastructure support. Many of these services can be delivered entirely or partially through cloud or as-a-Service delivery models. The companyÕs services are provided on a time-and-material basis, as a fixedprice contract or as a fixed-price per measure of output contract and the contract terms range from less than one year to over 10 years. \\nIn services arrangements, the company typically satisfies the performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time. In design and build arrangements, the performance obligation is satisfied over time either because the client controls the asset as it is created (e.g., when the asset is built at the customer site) or because the companyÕs performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and the company has an enforceable right to payment plus a reasonable profit for performance completed to date. In most other services arrangements, the performance obligation is satisfied over time because the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the company performs the services. \\nRevenue from time-and-material contracts is recognized on an output basis as labor hours are delivered and/or direct expenses are incurred. Revenue from as-a-Service type contracts, such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service, is recognized either on a straight-line basis or on a usage basis, depending on the terms of the arrangement (such as whether the company is standing ready to perform or whether the contract has usage-based metrics). If an as-a-Service contract includes setup activities, those promises in the arrangement are evaluated to determine if they are distinct. \\nIn areas such as application management, business process outsourcing and other cloud-based services arrangements, the company determines whether the services performed during the initial phases of the arrangement, such as setup activities, are distinct. In most cases, the arrangement is a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service). The company applies a measure of progress (typically time-based) to any fixed consideration and allocates variable consideration to the distinct periods of service based on usage. As a result, revenue is generally recognized over the period the services are provided on a usage basis. This results in revenue recognition that corresponds with the value to the client of the services transferred to date relative to the remaining services promised. \\nRevenue related to maintenance and technology support and extended warranty is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of performance because the company is standing ready to provide services. \\nIn design and build contracts, revenue is recognized based on progress toward completion of the performance obligation using a costto-cost measure of progress. Revenue is recognized based on the labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs to fulfill the contract. Due to the nature of the work performed in these arrangements, the estimation of cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Key factors reviewed by the company to estimate costs to complete each contract are future labor and product costs and expected productivity efficiencies. Changes in original estimates are reflected in revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known by the company. Refer to note D, ÒRevenue Recognition,Ó for the amount of revenue recognized in the reporting period on a cumulative catch-up basis (i.e., from performance obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in previous periods). \\nThe company performs ongoing profitability analyses of its design and build services contracts accounted for using a cost-to-cost measure of progress in order to determine whether the latest estimates of revenues, costs and profits require updating. If at any time these estimates indicate that the contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately. For other types of services contracts, any losses are recorded as incurred. \\nIn some services contracts, the company bills the client prior to recognizing revenue from performing the services. Deferred income of $3,460 million and $3,604 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In other services contracts, the company performs the services prior to billing the client. When the company performs services prior to billing the client in design and build contracts, the right to consideration is typically subject to milestone completion or client acceptance and the unbilled accounts receivable is classified as a contract asset. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, contract assets for services contracts of $430 million and $376 million, respectively, are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining amount of unbilled accounts receivable of $723 million and $650 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, is included in notes and accounts receivableÐtrade in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \\nBillings usually occur in the month after the company performs the services or in accordance with specific contractual provisions. \\nHardware \\nThe companyÕs hardware offerings include the sale or lease of Hybrid Infrastructure solutions including Z systems as well as Distributed Infrastructure solutions such as Power and storage solutions. The capabilities of these products can also be delivered through as-aService or cloud delivery models, such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Storage-as-a-Service. The company also offers installation services for its more complex hardware products. Hardware offerings are often sold with distinct maintenance services, described in the Services section above. \\nRevenue from hardware sales is recognized when control has transferred to the customer which typically occurs when the hardware has been shipped to the client, risk of loss has transferred to the client and the company has a present right to payment for the hardware. In limited circumstances when a hardware sale includes client acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized either when client acceptance has been obtained, client acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the company has objective evidence that the criteria specified in the client acceptance provisions have been satisfied. Revenue from hardware sales-type leases is recognized at the beginning of the lease term. Revenue from rentals and operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the rental or lease. \\nRevenue from as-a-Service arrangements is recognized either on a straight-line basis or on a usage basis as described in the Services section above. Installation services are accounted for as distinct performance obligations with revenue recognized as the services are performed. Shipping and handling activities that occur after the client has obtained control of a product are accounted for as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product rather than as an additional promised service and, therefore, no revenue is deferred and recognized over the shipping period. \\nSoftware \\nThe companyÕs software offerings include hybrid platform software solutions, which contain many of the companyÕs strategic areas including Red Hat, automation, data and AI, and security; transaction processing, which primarily supports mission-critical systems for clients; and, distributed infrastructure software, which provides operating systems for IBM Z and Power Systems hardware. These offerings include proprietary software and open source software, and many can be delivered entirely or partially through as-a-Service or cloud delivery models, while others are delivered as on-premise software licenses. \\nRevenue from proprietary perpetual (one-time charge) license software is recognized at a point in time at the inception of the arrangement when control transfers to the client, if the software license is distinct from the post-contract support (PCS) offered by the company.  \\nRevenue from proprietary term license software is recognized at a point in time for the committed term of the contract, unless consideration depends on client usage, in which case revenue is recognized when the usage occurs. \\nProprietary term licenses often have a one-month contract term due to client termination rights, in which case, revenue would be recognized in that month for both the license and PCS. Clients may contract to convert their existing IBM term license software into perpetual license software plus PCS. When proprietary term license software is converted to perpetual license software, the consideration becomes fixed with no cancellability and, therefore, revenue for the perpetual license is recognized upon conversion, consistent with the accounting for other perpetual licenses, as described above. PCS revenue is recognized as described below. \\nThe company also has open source software offerings. Since open source software is offered under an open source licensing model and therefore, the license is available for free, the standalone selling price is zero. As such, when the license is sold with PCS or other products and services, no consideration is allocated to the license when it is a distinct performance obligation and therefore no revenue is recognized when control of the license transfers to the client. Revenue is recognized over the PCS period. In certain cases, open source software is bundled with proprietary software and, if the open source software is not considered distinct, the software bundle (e.g., Cloud Pak) is accounted for under a proprietary software model. Cloud Paks can be sold either as perpetual or committed-term software licenses, both of which are described above. \\nRevenue from PCS is recognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis because the company is providing a service of standing ready to provide support, when-and-if needed, and is providing unspecified software upgrades on a when-and-if available basis over the contract term. \\nRevenue from software hosting or Software-as-a-Service arrangements is recognized either on a straight-line basis or on a usage basis as described in the Services section above. In software hosting arrangements, the rights provided to the client (e.g., ownership of a license, contract termination provisions and the feasibility of the client to operate the software) are considered in determining whether the arrangement includes a license. In arrangements that include a software license, the associated revenue is recognized in accordance with the software license recognition policy above rather than over time as a service. \\nFinancing \\nFinancing income attributable to sales-type leases, direct financing leases and loans is recognized on the accrual basis using the effective interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\nStandalone Selling Price \\nThe company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price (SSP) is the price at which the company would sell a promised product or service separately to a client. In most cases, the company is able to establish SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar clients. The company typically establishes SSP ranges for its products and services which are reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. \\nIn certain instances, the company may not be able to establish a SSP range based on observable prices and the company estimates SSP. The company estimates SSP by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, overall market conditions, including geographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, competitor actions, internal costs, profit objectives and pricing practices. Additionally, in certain circumstances, the company may estimate SSP for a product or service by applying the residual approach. Estimating SSP is a formal process that includes review and approval by the companyÕs management. \\nServices Costs \\nRecurring operating costs for services contracts are recognized as incurred. For fixed-price design and build contracts, the costs of external hardware and software accounted for under the cost-to-cost measure of progress are deferred and recognized based on the labor costs incurred to date (i.e., the measure of progress), as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs to fulfill the contract as control transfers over time for these performance obligations. Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (i.e., setup costs) incurred in the initial phases of business process outsourcing contracts and other cloud-based services contracts, including Software-as-a-Service arrangements, are capitalized when the costs relate directly to the contract, the costs generate or enhance resources of the company that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future, and the costs are expected to be recovered. These costs consist of transition and setup costs related to the provisioning, configuring, implementation and training and other deferred fulfillment costs, including, for example, prepaid assets used in services contracts (i.e., prepaid software or prepaid maintenance). Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which includes anticipated contract renewals or extensions, consistent with the transfer to the client of the services to which the asset relates. Additionally, fixed assets associated with these contracts are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset. If an asset is contract specific, then the depreciation period is the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the contract term. Amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair value of acquired assets used in business process outsourcing arrangements are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of revenue over the expected period of benefit. The company performs periodic reviews to assess the recoverability of deferred contract transition and setup costs. If the carrying amount is deemed not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized. Refer to note D, ÒRevenue Recognition,Ó for the amount of deferred costs to fulfill a contract at December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\n \\nIn situations in which a business process outsourcing or other cloud-based services contract is terminated, the terms of the contract may require the client to reimburse the company for the recovery of unbilled accounts receivable, unamortized deferred contract costs and additional costs incurred by the company to transition the services. \\nSoftware Costs \\nCosts that are related to the conceptual formulation and design of licensed software programs are expensed as incurred to research, development and engineering expense; costs that are incurred to produce the finished product after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized as an intangible asset. Capitalized amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging up to three years and are recorded in software cost within cost of sales. The company performs periodic reviews to ensure that unamortized program costs remain recoverable from future revenue. Costs to support or service licensed programs are charged to software cost within cost of sales as incurred. \\nThe company capitalizes certain costs that are incurred to purchase or develop internal-use software. Internal-use software programs also include software used by the company to deliver Software-as-a-Service when the client does not receive a license to the software and the company has no substantive plans to market the software externally. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging up to three years and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense or cost of sales, depending on whether the software is used by the company in revenue generating transactions. Additionally, the company may capitalize certain types of implementation costs and amortize them over the term of the arrangement when the company is a customer in a cloudcomputing arrangement. \\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract \\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract (e.g., sales commissions) are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected customer relationship period if the company expects to recover those costs. The expected customer relationship period is determined based on the average customer relationship period, including expected renewals, for each offering type and ranges from three to six years. Expected renewal periods are only included in the expected customer relationship period if commission amounts paid upon renewal are not commensurate with amounts paid on the initial contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs the company incurs to obtain a contract that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The company has determined that certain commissions programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Some commission programs are not subject to capitalization as the commission expense is paid and recognized as the related revenue is recognized. Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company expenses costs to obtain a contract as incurred if the amortization period would have been a year or less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. \\nProduct Warranties \\nThe company offers warranties for its hardware products that generally range up to three years, with the majority being either one or three years. Any cost of standard warranties is accrued when the corresponding revenue is recognized. The company estimates its standard warranty costs for products based on historical warranty claim experience and estimates of future spending and applies this estimate to the revenue stream for products under warranty. Estimated future costs for warranties applicable to revenue recognized in the current period are charged to cost of sales. The warranty liability is reviewed quarterly to verify that it properly reflects the remaining obligation based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period. Adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates. Costs from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts, are recognized as incurred. \\nRevenue from extended warranty contracts is initially recorded as deferred income and subsequently recognized on a straight-line basis over the delivery period because the company is providing a service of standing ready to provide services over such term. \\nRefer to note S, ÒCommitments & Contingencies,Ó for additional information. \\nShipping and Handling \\nCosts related to shipping and handling are recognized as incurred and included in cost in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nExpense and Other Income \\nSelling, General and Administrative \\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense is charged to income as incurred, except for certain sales commissions, which are capitalized and amortized. For further information regarding capitalizing sales commissions, see ÒIncremental Costs of Obtaining a ContractÓ above. Expenses of promoting and selling products and services are classified as selling expense and, in addition to sales commissions, include such items as compensation, advertising and travel. General and administrative expense includes such items as compensation, legal costs, office supplies, non-income taxes, insurance and office rental. In addition, general and administrative expense includes other operating items such as an allowance for credit losses, workforce rebalancing charges for contractually obligated payments to employees terminated in the ongoing course of business, acquisition costs related to business combinations, amortization of certain intangible assets and environmental remediation costs. \\nAdvertising and Promotional Expense \\nThe company expenses advertising and promotional costs as incurred. Cooperative advertising reimbursements from vendors are recorded net of advertising and promotional expense in the period in which the related advertising and promotional expense is incurred. Advertising and promotional expense, which includes media, agency and promotional expense, was $1,413 million, $1,509 million and $1,591 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is recorded in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nResearch, Development and Engineering \\nResearch, development and engineering (RD&E) costs are expensed as incurred. Software costs that are incurred to produce the finished product after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized as an intangible asset. \\nIntellectual Property and Custom Development Income \\nThe company licenses and sells the rights to certain of its intellectual property (IP) including internally developed patents, trade secrets and technological know-how. Certain IP transactions to third parties are licensing/royalty-based and others are transaction-based sales/other transfers. Income from licensing arrangements is recognized at the inception of the license term if the nature of the companyÕs promise is to provide a right to use the companyÕs intellectual property as it exists at that point in time (i.e., the license is functional intellectual property) and control has transferred to the client. Income is recognized over time if the nature of the companyÕs promise is to provide a right to access the companyÕs intellectual property throughout the license period (i.e., the license is symbolic intellectual property), such as a trademark license. Income from royalty-based fee arrangements is recognized at the later of when the subsequent sale or usage occurs or the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). The company also enters into cross-licensing arrangements of patents, and income from these arrangements is recognized when control transfers to the customer. In addition, the company earns income from certain custom development projects with strategic technology partners and specific clients. The company records the income from these projects over time as the company satisfies the performance obligation if the fee is nonrefundable and is not dependent upon the ultimate success of the project. \\nOther (Income) and Expense \\nOther (income) and expense includes interest income (other than from Financing external transactions), gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, gains and losses from securities and other investments including the changes in fair value associated with the companyÕs retained interest in Kyndryl common stock, gains and losses from certain real estate transactions, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, gains and losses from the sale of financial assets, gains and losses from the sale of businesses, other than reported as discontinued operations, and amounts related to accretion of asset retirement obligations. Other (income) and expense also includes certain components of retirement-related costs, including interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs/(credits), curtailments and settlements and other net periodic pension/post-retirement benefit costs. \\nBusiness Combinations and Intangible Assets Including Goodwill \\nThe company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are generally recorded at their acquisition date fair values. Contract assets and contract liabilities are measured in accordance with the guidance on revenue recognition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. The primary drivers that generate goodwill are the value of synergies between the acquired entities and the company and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies as a separately identifiable intangible asset. Goodwill recorded in an acquisition is assigned to applicable reporting units based on expected revenues or expected cash flows. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Amortization of completed technology is recorded in cost, and amortization of all other intangible assets is recorded in SG&A expense. Acquisition-related costs, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and pre-close and other costs, are typically expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred and are recorded in SG&A expense. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date. \\nImpairment \\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill, are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment test is typically based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, the asset is written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter and whenever changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below an operating segment. \\nDepreciation and Amortization \\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of certain depreciable assets are as follows: buildings, 30 to 50 years; building equipment, 10 to 20 years; land improvements, 20 years; production, engineering, office and other equipment, 2 to 20 years; and information technology equipment, 1.5 to 5 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term, rarely exceeding 25 years. \\nAs noted within the ÒSoftware CostsÓ section of this note, capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging up to 3 years. Other intangible assets are amortized over periods between 1 and 20 years. \\n \t \\nEnvironmental \\nThe cost of internal environmental protection programs that are preventative in nature are expensed as incurred. When a cleanup program becomes likely, and it is probable that the company will incur cleanup costs and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the company accrues remediation costs for known environmental liabilities. \\nAsset Retirement Obligations \\nAsset retirement obligations (ARO) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability is initially recorded at fair value. The related asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related assets by the same amount as the liability. Asset retirement costs are subsequently depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, the company records period-to-period changes in the ARO liability resulting from the passage of time in interest expense and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original expected cash flows to the related assets. \\nDefined Benefit Pension and Nonpension Postretirement Benefit Plans \\nThe funded status of the companyÕs defined benefit pension plans and nonpension postretirement benefit plans (retirement-related benefit plans) is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at December 31, the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation (PBO), which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on employee services already rendered and estimated future compensation levels. For the nonpension postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO), which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of assets held in an irrevocable trust fund, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trust fund. Overfunded plans, with the fair value of plan assets exceeding the benefit obligation, are aggregated and recorded as a prepaid pension asset equal to this excess. Underfunded plans, with the benefit obligation exceeding the fair value of plan assets, are aggregated and recorded as a retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligation equal to this excess. \\nThe current portion of the retirement and nonpension post-retirement benefit obligations represents the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next 12 months exceeding the fair value of plan assets, measured on a plan-by-plan basis. This obligation is recorded in compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \\nNet periodic pension and nonpension postretirement benefit cost/(income) is recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement and includes service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs/(credits) and (gains)/losses previously recognized as a component of other comprehensive income/(loss) (OCI) and amortization of the net transition asset remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI). The service cost component of net benefit cost is recorded in Cost, SG&A and RD&E in the Consolidated Income Statement (unless eligible for capitalization) based on the employeesÕ respective functions. The other components of net benefit cost are presented separately from service cost within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\n(Gains)/losses and prior service costs/(credits) are recognized as a component of OCI in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as they arise. Those (gains)/losses and prior service costs/(credits) are subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic cost/(income) pursuant to the recognition and amortization provisions of applicable accounting guidance. (Gains)/losses arise as a result of differences between actual experience and assumptions or as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions. Prior service costs/(credits) represent the cost of benefit changes attributable to prior service granted in plan amendments. \\nThe measurement of benefit obligations and net periodic cost/(income) is based on estimates and assumptions approved by the companyÕs management. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age and years of service, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, interest crediting rates and mortality rates. \\nDefined Contribution Plans \\nThe companyÕs contribution for defined contribution plans is recorded when the employee renders service to the company. The charge is recorded in Cost, SG&A and RD&E in the Consolidated Income Statement based on the employeesÕ respective functions. \\nStock-Based Compensation \\nStock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees. The company measures stockbased compensation cost at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost on a straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the employee requisite service period. The company grants its employees Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), including Retention Restricted Stock Units (RRSUs); Performance Share Units (PSUs); and stock options. RSUs are stock awards granted to employees that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests, typically over a one- to five-year period. PSUs are stock awards where the number of shares ultimately received by the employee depends on the companyÕs performance against specified targets and typically vest over a three-year period. Over the performance period, the number of shares that will be issued is adjusted based upon the probability of achievement of performance targets. The ultimate number of shares issued and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets. Dividend equivalents are not paid on the stock awards described above. The fair value of the awards is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the companyÕs stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents where applicable and for PSUs assumes that performance targets will be achieved. The company estimates the fair value of stock options using a BlackScholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation cost is recorded in Cost, SG&A, and RD&E in the Consolidated Income Statement based on the employeesÕ respective functions. \\nThe company records deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on the companyÕs income tax returns, based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and the relevant statutory tax rates. The differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on the income tax return are recorded as a benefit or expense to the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nIncome Taxes \\nIncome tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between asset and liability amounts that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws. The company includes Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) in measuring deferred taxes. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies/actions. When the company changes its determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, the valuation allowance is adjusted with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. \\nThe company recognizes additional tax liabilities when the company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Benefits from tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The noncurrent portion of tax liabilities is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To the extent that new information becomes available which causes the company to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities, such changes to tax liabilities will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. Interest and penalties, if any, related to accrued liabilities for potential tax assessments are included in income tax expense. \\nTranslation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts \\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that have a local functional currency are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments are recorded in OCI. Income and expense items are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. \\nInventory, property, plant and equipmentÑnet and other non-monetary assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars are translated at the approximate exchange rates prevailing when the company acquired the assets or liabilities. All other assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars are translated at year-end exchange rates with the transaction gain or loss recognized in other (income) and expense. Income and expense items are translated at the weightedaverage rates of exchange prevailing during the year. These translation gains and losses are included in net income for the period in which exchange rates change. \\nDerivative Financial Instruments \\nThe company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage foreign currency and interest rate risk, and to a lesser extent, equity and credit risk. The company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting can be designated as either cash flow hedges, net investment hedges, or fair value hedges. The company may enter into derivative contracts that economically hedge certain of its risks, even when hedge accounting does not apply, or the company elects not to apply hedge accounting. \\nDerivatives are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value on a gross basis as either assets or liabilities and classified as current or noncurrent based upon whether the maturity of the instrument is less than or greater than 12 months. \\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded, net of applicable taxes, in OCI and subsequently reclassified into the same income statement line as the hedged exposure when the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. Effectiveness for net investment hedging derivatives is measured on a spot-to-spot basis. Changes in the fair value of highly effective net investment hedging derivatives and other non-derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in AOCI. Changes in the fair value of the portion of a net investment hedging derivative excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in interest expense and cost of financing. Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives designated as a fair value hedge and the offsetting changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure are recorded in interest expense and cost of financing. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are reported in earnings primarily in other (income) and expense. See note U, ÒDerivative Financial Instruments,Ó for further information. \\nThe cash flows associated with derivatives designated as fair value and cash flow hedges are reported in cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash flows from derivatives designated as net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedges are reported in cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash flows from derivatives designated as hedges of foreign currency denominated debt directly associated with the settlement of the principal are reported in payments to settle debt in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \\nFinancial Instruments \\nIn determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. See note J, ÒFinancial Assets & Liabilities,Ó for further information. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. \\nFair Value Measurement \\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The company classifies certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy: \\n¥ Level 1ÐQuoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the measurement date; \\n¥ Level 2ÐInputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and \\n¥ Level 3ÐUnobservable inputs for the asset or liability. \\nWhen available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. \\nThe determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument. \\nIn determining the fair value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation adjustments to the Òbase valuationsÓ calculated using the methodologies described below for several parameters that market participants would consider in determining fair value: \\n¥ Counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument. \\n¥ Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect the companyÕs own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the companyÕs own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market. \\nThe company holds investments primarily in time deposits, certificates of deposit, and U.S. government debt that are designated as available-for-sale. The primary objective of the companyÕs cash and debt investment portfolio is to maintain principal by investing in very liquid and highly rated investment grade securities. \\nAvailable-for-sale securities are measured for impairment on a recurring basis by comparing the securityÕs fair value with its amortized cost basis. Effective January 1, 2020 with the adoption of the new standard on credit losses, if the fair value of the security falls below its amortized cost basis, the change in fair value is recognized in the period the impairment is identified when the loss is due to credit factors. The change in fair value due to non-credit factors is recorded in other comprehensive income when the company does not intend to sell and has the ability to hold the investment. The companyÕs standard practice is to hold all of its debt security investments classified as available-for-sale until maturity. There were no impairments for credit losses and no material non-credit impairments recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Prior to the adoption of the new standard, available-for-sale securities were measured for impairment using an other-than-temporary impairment model. No impairment was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019. \\nCertain nonfinancial assets such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets depend on the type of asset. There were no material impairments of nonfinancial assets for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. \\nCash Equivalents \\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. \\nMarketable Securities \\nThe company measures equity investments at fair value with changes recognized in net income. \\nDebt securities included in current assets represent securities that are expected to be realized in cash within one year of the balance sheet date. Long-term debt securities and alliance equity securities are included in investments and sundry assets. Debt securities are considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, in OCI. The realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Realized gains and losses are calculated based on the specific identification method. \\nInventory \\nRaw materials, work in process and finished goods are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. \\nNotes and Accounts ReceivableÑTrade and Contract Assets \\nThe company classifies the right to consideration in exchange for products or services transferred to a client as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional as compared to a contract asset which is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. The majority of the companyÕs contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to design and build services contracts when the cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized, revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client, and the right to consideration is subject to milestone completion or client acceptance. Contract assets are generally classified as current and are recorded on a net basis with deferred income (i.e., contract liabilities) at the contract level. \\nFinancing Receivables \\nFinancing receivables primarily consist of client loan and installment payment receivables (loans) and investment in sales-type and direct financing leases (collectively referred to as client financing receivables) and commercial financing receivables. Leases are accounted for in accordance with lease accounting standards. Loans, which are generally unsecured, are primarily for software and services. Commercial financing receivables are primarily for working capital financing to distributors and resellers of IBM products and services. Financing receivables are classified as either held for sale or held for investment, depending on the companyÕs intent and ability to hold the underlying contract for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff. Loans and commercial financing receivables are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.  \\nTransfers of Financial Assets \\nThe company enters into arrangements to sell certain financial assets (primarily notes and accounts receivableÐtrade and financing receivables) to third-party financial institutions. For a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale, the asset must be legally isolated from the company and the purchaser must have control of the asset. Determining whether all the requirements have been met includes an evaluation of legal considerations, the extent of the companyÕs continuing involvement with the assets transferred and any other relevant consideration. When the true sale criteria are met, the company derecognizes the carrying value of the financial asset transferred and recognizes a net gain or loss on the sale. The proceeds from these arrangements are reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. If the true sale criteria are not met, the transfer is considered a secured borrowing and the financial asset remains on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with proceeds from the sale recognized as debt and recorded as cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \\nArrangements to sell notes and accounts receivableÐtrade are used in the normal course of business as part of the companyÕs cash and liquidity management. Facilities primarily in the U.S., Canada and several countries in Europe enable the company to sell certain notes and accounts receivableÐtrade, without recourse, to third parties in order to manage credit, collection, concentration and currency risk. The gross amounts sold (the gross proceeds) under these arrangements were $1.8 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Within the notes and accounts receivablesÐtrade sold and derecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, $0.7 billion, $0.4 billion, and $0.4 billion remained uncollected from customers at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fees and the net gains and losses associated with the transfer of receivables were not material for any of the periods presented. Refer to note L, ÒFinancing Receivables,Ó for more information on transfers of financing receivables. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nEffective January 1, 2020, the company adopted the new accounting standard related to current expected credit losses. The standard applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans, net investments in leases, trade accounts receivable and certain off-balance sheet commitments. As of the effective date, the company estimates its allowance for current expected credit losses based on an expected loss model, compared to prior periods which were estimated using an incurred loss model. The impact related to adopting the new standard was not material. Certain changes resulting from the new standard impacted the companyÕs description of its significant accounting policies compared to 2019. For further information regarding the adoption of the new standard, see note B, ÒAccounting Changes.Ó \\nReceivables are recorded concurrent with billing and shipment of a product and/or delivery of a service to customers. An allowance for uncollectible trade receivables and contract assets, if needed, is estimated based on specific customer situations, current and future expected economic conditions, past experiences of losses, as well as an assessment of potential recoverability of the balance due. \\nThe company estimates its allowances for expected credit losses for financing receivables by considering past events, including any historical default, historical concessions and resulting troubled debt restructurings, current economic conditions, any non-freestanding mitigating credit enhancements, and certain forward-looking information, including reasonable and supportable forecasts. As of January 1, 2020, the methodologies that the company uses to calculate its financing receivables reserves, which are applied consistently to its different portfolios, are as follows: \\nIndividually EvaluatedÐThe company reviews all financing receivables considered at risk quarterly, and performs an analysis based upon current information available about the client, such as financial statements, news reports, published credit ratings, current market-implied credit analysis, as well as collateral net of repossession cost, prior collection history and current and future expected economic conditions. For loans that are collateral dependent, impairment is measured using the fair value of the collateral when foreclosure is probable. Using this information, the company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts in which the loss is probable, the company records a specific reserve. \\nCollectively EvaluatedÐThe company determines its allowances for credit losses for collectively evaluated financing receivables (unallocated) based on two portfolio segments: client financing receivables and commercial financing receivables. The company further segments the portfolio into three classes: Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific. \\nFor client financing receivables, the company uses a credit loss model to calculate allowances based on its internal loss experience and current conditions and forecasts, by class of financing receivable. The company records an unallocated reserve that is calculated by applying a reserve rate to its portfolio, excluding accounts that have been individually evaluated and specifically reserved. This reserve rate is based upon credit rating, probability of default, term and loss history. The allowance is adjusted quarterly for expected recoveries of amounts that were previously written off or are expected to be written off. Recoveries cannot exceed the aggregated amount of the previous write-off or expected write-off.  \\nThe company considers forward-looking macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rates, equity prices and corporate profits when quantifying the impact of economic forecasts on its client financing receivables allowance for expected credit losses. Macroeconomic variables may vary by class of financing receivables based on historical experiences, portfolio composition and current environment. The company also considers the impact of current conditions and economic forecasts relating to specific industries, geographical areas, and client credit ratings, in addition to performing a qualitative review of credit risk factors across the portfolio. Under this approach, forecasts of these variables over two years are considered reasonable and supportable. Beyond two years, the company reverts to long-term average loss experience. Forward-looking estimates require the use of judgment, particularly in times of economic uncertainty. \\nThe portfolio of commercial financing receivables is short term in nature and any allowance for these assets is estimated based on a combination of write-off history and current economic conditions, excluding any individually evaluated accounts. \\nOther Credit-Related Policies \\nPast DueÐThe company views receivables as past due when payment has not been received after 90 days, measured from the original billing date. \\nNon-AccrualÐNon-accrual assets include those receivables (impaired loans or nonperforming leases) with specific reserves and other accounts for which it is likely that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to original terms of the lease or loan agreement. Interest income recognition is discontinued on these receivables. Cash collections are first applied as a reduction to principal outstanding. Any cash received in excess of principal payments outstanding is recognized as interest income. Receivables may be removed from non-accrual status, if appropriate, based upon changes in client circumstances, such as a sustained history of payments. \\nWrite-OffÐReceivable losses are charged against the allowance in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Write-offs of receivables and associated reserves occur to the extent that the customer is no longer in operation and/or there is no reasonable expectation of additional collections or repossession. \\nLeases \\nThe company conducts business as both a lessee and a lessor. In its ordinary course of business, the company enters into leases as a lessee for property, plant and equipment. The company is also the lessor of certain equipment, mainly through its Financing segment. \\nWhen procuring goods or services, or upon entering into a contract with its clients, the company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at its inception. As part of that evaluation, the company considers whether there is an implicitly or explicitly identified asset in the arrangement and whether the company, as the lessee, or the client, if the company is the lessor, has the right to control the use of that asset. \\nAccounting for Leases as a Lessee \\nWhen the company is the lessee, all leases with a term of more than 12 months are recognized as right-of-use (ROU) assets and associated lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the lease payments not yet paid and the companyÕs incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which the company would borrow on a secured basis in the country where the lease was executed. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where the company is the lessee. The ROU asset equals the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs (IDCs), prepaid rent and lease incentives. The companyÕs variable lease payments generally relate to payments tied to various indexes, non-lease components and payments above a contractual minimum fixed amount. \\nOperating leases are included in operating right-of-use assetsÐnet, current operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, short-term debt and long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option. \\nThe company made a policy election to not recognize leases with a lease term of 12 months or less in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \\nFor all asset classes, the company has elected the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) and account for the combined unit as a single lease component. A significant portion of the companyÕs lease portfolio is real estate, which are mainly accounted for as operating leases, and are primarily used for corporate offices and data centers. The average term of the real estate leases is approximately five years. The company also has equipment leases, such as IT equipment and vehicles, which have lease terms that range from two to five years. For certain of these operating and finance leases, the company applies a portfolio approach to account for the lease assets and lease liabilities. \\nAccounting for Leases as a Lessor \\nThe company typically enters into leases as an alternative means of realizing value from equipment that it would otherwise sell. Assets under lease include new and used IBM equipment and certain OEM products. IBM equipment generally consists of IBM Z, Power and Storage products. \\nLease payments due to IBM are typically fixed and paid in equal installments over the lease term. The majority of the companyÕs leases do not contain variable payments that are dependent on an index or a rate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate (e.g., property taxes), that are paid directly by the company and are reimbursed by the client, are recorded as revenue, along with the related cost, in the period in which collection of these payments is probable. Payments that are made directly by the client to a third party, including certain property taxes and insurance, are not considered part of variable payments and therefore are not recorded by the company. The company has made a policy election to exclude from consideration in contracts all collections from sales and other similar taxes. \\nThe companyÕs payment terms for leases are typically unconditional. Therefore, in an instance when the client requests to terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term, the client would typically be required to pay the remaining lease payments in full. At the end of the lease term, the company allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment at the then-current fair market value or at a pre-stated purchase price, or renew the lease based on mutually agreed upon terms. \\nWhen lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration in the contract between the lease components and the non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis. \\nSales-Type and Direct Financing Leases \\nFor a sales-type or direct financing lease, the carrying amount of the asset is derecognized from inventory and a net investment in the lease is recorded. For a sales-type lease, the net investment in the lease is measured at commencement date as the sum of the lease receivable and the estimated residual value of the equipment less unearned income and allowance for credit losses. Any selling profit or loss arising from a sales-type lease is recorded at lease commencement. Selling profit or loss is presented on a gross basis when the company enters into a lease to realize value from a product that it would otherwise sell in its ordinary course of business, whereas in transactions where the company enters into a lease for the purpose of generating revenue by providing financing, the selling profit or loss is presented on a net basis. Under a sales-type lease, initial direct costs are expensed at lease commencement. Over the term of the lease, the company recognizes finance income on the net investment in the lease and any variable lease payments, which are not included in the net investment in the lease. \\nFor a direct financing lease, the net investment in the lease is measured similarly to a sales-type lease, however, the net investment in the lease is reduced by any selling profit. In a direct financing lease, the selling profit and initial direct costs are deferred at commencement and recognized over the lease term. The company rarely enters into direct financing leases. \\nThe estimated residual value represents the estimated fair value of the equipment under lease at the end of the lease. Estimating residual value is a risk unique to financing activities, and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values. The company has insight into product plans and cycles for IBM products under lease. The company estimates the future fair value of leased equipment by using historical models, analyzing the current market for new and used equipment, and obtaining forward-looking product information such as marketing plans and technology innovations. \\nThe company optimizes the recovery of residual values by extending lease arrangements with, or selling leased equipment to existing clients. The company manages residual value risk through insight into its own product cycles. The company periodically reassesses the realizable value of its lease residual values. Anticipated decreases in specific future residual values that are considered to be otherthan-temporary are recognized immediately upon identification and are recorded as an adjustment to the residual value estimate. For sales-type and direct financing leases, this reduction lowers the recorded net investment and is recognized as a loss charged to finance income in the period in which the estimate is changed, as well as an adjustment to unearned income to reduce future-period financing income. \\nOperating Leases \\nEquipment provided to clients under an operating lease is carried at cost within property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and depreciated over the lease term using the straight-line method, generally ranging from one to four years. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. \\nAt commencement of an operating lease, IDCs are deferred. As lease payments are made, the company records sales revenue over the lease term. IDCs are amortized over the lease term on the same basis as lease income is recorded. \\nAssets under operating leases are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment test is based on undiscounted cash flows, and, if impaired, the asset is written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. \\nCommon Stock \\nCommon stock refers to the $.20 par value per share capital stock as designated in the companyÕs Certificate of Incorporation. Treasury stock is accounted for using the cost method. When treasury stock is reissued, the value is computed and recorded using a weightedaverage basis. \\nEarnings Per Share of Common Stock \\nEarnings per share (EPS) is computed using the two-class method, which determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends and dividend equivalents and their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Basic EPS of common stock is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS of common stock is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock awards, convertible notes and stock options.  \\nNOTE B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES \\nNew Standards to be Implemented \\nDisclosures about Government Assistance \\nStandard/DescriptionÐIssuance date: November 2021. This guidance requires an entity to provide certain annual disclosures about government assistance received and accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. \\nEffective Date and Adoption ConsiderationsÐThe guidance is effective for annual disclosures beginning in 2022 and early adoption was permitted. The company will adopt the guidance as of the effective date. \\nEffect on Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersÐAs the guidance is a change to disclosures only, the company does not expect it to have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. \\nLessorsÐCertain Leases with Variable Lease Payments \\nStandard/DescriptionÐIssuance date: July 2021. This guidance modifies a lessorÕs accounting for certain leases with variable lease payments that resulted in the recognition of a day-one loss even if the lessor expected the arrangement to be profitable overall. The amendment requires these types of lease contracts to be classified as operating leases which eliminates any recognition of a day-one loss. \\nEffective Date and Adoption ConsiderationsÐThe amendment is effective January 1, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The company adopted the guidance on a prospective basis as of the effective date. \\nEffect on Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersÐThe guidance is not expected to have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. \\nStandards Implemented \\nRevenue Contracts with Customers Acquired in a Business Combination \\nStandard/DescriptionÐIssuance date: October 2021. This guidance requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with revenue guidance, as if it had originated the contracts. Deferred revenue acquired in a business combination is no longer required to be measured at its fair value, but rather will generally be recognized at the same basis as the acquiree. \\nEffective Date and Adoption ConsiderationsÐThe amendment is effective January 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The company adopted the guidance as of October 1, 2021 using the retrospective transition method whereby the new guidance was applied to all business combinations that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2021. \\nEffect on Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersÐThe guidance did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. The impact of the guidance in IBMÕs future financial results will be dependent on the nature and size of its acquisitions. \\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes \\nStandard/DescriptionÐIssuance date: December 2019. This guidance simplifies various aspects of income tax accounting by removing certain exceptions to the general principle of the guidance and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistency in application. \\nEffective Date and Adoption ConsiderationsÐThe guidance was effective January 1, 2021 and early adoption was permitted. The company adopted the guidance on a prospective basis as of the effective date. \\nEffect on Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersÐThe guidance did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. \\nReference Rate Reform \\nStandard/DescriptionÐIssuance date: March 2020, with amendments in 2021. This guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued, subject to meeting certain criteria. \\nEffective Date and Adoption ConsiderationsÐThe guidance is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022.  \\nEffect on Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersÐThe company made a policy election in the first quarter of 2020 to adopt the practical expedient which allows for the continuation of fair value hedge accounting for interest rate derivative contracts upon the transition from LIBOR to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or another reference rate alternative, without any impact to the Consolidated Income Statement. The replacement of the LIBOR benchmark within the companyÕs interest rate risk management activities did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. \\nSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment \\nStandard/DescriptionÐIssuance date: January 2017. This guidance simplifies the goodwill impairment test by removing Step 2. It also requires disclosure of any reporting units that have zero or negative carrying amounts if they have goodwill allocated to them. \\nEffective Date and Adoption ConsiderationsÐThe guidance was effective January 1, 2020 and early adoption was permitted. The company adopted the guidance on a prospective basis as of the effective date. \\nEffect on Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersÐThe guidance did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. \\nFinancial InstrumentsÐCredit Losses \\nStandard/DescriptionÐIssuance date: June 2016, with amendments in 2018, 2019, and 2020. This changes the guidance for credit losses based on an expected loss model rather than an incurred loss model. It requires the consideration of all available relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including past events, current conditions and forecasts and their implications for expected credit losses. It also expands the scope of financial instruments subject to impairment, including off-balance sheet commitments and residual value. \\nEffective Date and Adoption ConsiderationsÐThe guidance was effective January 1, 2020 with one-year early adoption permitted. The company adopted the guidance as of the effective date, using the transition methodology whereby prior comparative periods were not retrospectively presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \\nEffect on Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersÐAt January 1, 2020, an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $81 million was recorded for accounts receivableÐtrade and financing receivables (inclusive of its related off-balance sheet commitments). Additionally, net deferred taxes were reduced by $14 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, resulting in a cumulative effect net decrease to retained earnings of $66 million. \\nFor all other standards that the company adopted in the periods presented, there was no material impact in the consolidated financial results. \\nNOTE C. SEPARATION OF KYNDRYL \\nOn November 3, 2021, the company completed the separation of its managed infrastructure services unit into a new public company with the distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding shares of Kyndryl to IBM stockholders on a pro rata basis. To effect the separation, IBM stockholders received one share of Kyndryl common stock for every five shares of IBM common stock held at the close of business on October 25, 2021, the record date for the distribution. The company retained 19.9 percent of the shares of Kyndryl common stock immediately following the separation with the intent to dispose of such shares within twelve months after the distribution. The accounting requirements for reporting the separation of Kyndryl as a discontinued operation were met when the separation was completed. Accordingly, the historical results of Kyndryl have been presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Prior to the separation, Kyndryl was predominantly reported within the companyÕs Global Technology Services segment. For additional information relating to the companyÕs segments, refer to note E, ÒSegments.Ó  \\nThe companyÕs presentation of discontinued operations excludes general corporate overhead costs which were historically allocated to Kyndryl, consistent with the companyÕs management system, that do not meet the requirements to be presented in discontinued operations. Such allocations include labor and non-labor expenses related to IBMÕs corporate support functions (e.g., finance, accounting, tax, treasury, IT, HR, legal, among others) that historically provided support to Kyndryl and transferred to Kyndryl at separation. In addition, discontinued operations excludes the historical intercompany purchases and sales between IBM and Kyndryl that were eliminated in consolidation. \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, prior to separation, Kyndryl completed the offering of $2.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed-rate notes and entered into a $500 million three-year variable-rate term loan. Cash raised from the debt issuance and term loan was used to fund KyndrylÕs opening cash balance, with the remaining net cash proceeds of $879 million paid by Kyndryl to IBM in the form of a dividend at separation which is included in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Following completion of the Kyndryl separation on November 3, 2021, the notes and term loan are no longer obligations of IBM. \\nSeparation costs of $1,042 million and $21 million incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are included in income from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Consolidated Income Statement. These charges primarily relate to transaction and third-party support costs, business separation and applicable employee retention fees, pension settlement charges and tax charges related to the Kyndryl separation. There were no separation costs incurred in 2019. \\nIBM and Kyndryl entered into various agreements to effect the separation and provide a framework for their on-going relationship, including a separation and distribution agreement, transition services agreement, employee matters agreement, tax matters agreement, intellectual property agreement, real estate matters agreement, client relationship agreement, master subcontracting agreement and a stockholderÕs and registration rights agreement. The transition services predominantly consist of information technology services that IBM will provide to Kyndryl for a period no longer than two years after the separation. The impact of these transition services on the companyÕs Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 was not material.  \\nIBM and Kyndryl entered into various commercial agreements pursuant to which Kyndryl will purchase hardware, software and services from IBM for use in the delivery of Kyndryl services agreements and under which IBM will receive services from Kyndryl, related to hosting data centers and servicing IBMÕs information infrastructure. As part of the separation, IBM has committed to provide Kyndryl upgraded hardware at no cost to Kyndryl over a two-year period after the separation. IBM recorded $265 million for the total estimate of IBMÕs obligation under the agreement to other accrued expenses and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \\nThe following table presents the major categories of income from discontinued operations: \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n($ in millions) \t \t \t \t  \t \t \t \t \t \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n     \\n2021 *? \\n2020 * \\n2019 * \\nRevenue \\n \\n$ 14,994  \\n$ 18,441   \\n$ 19,433  \\nCost of sales \\n \\n11,270   \\n13,651   \\n14,478   \\nSelling, general and administrative expense \\n \\n1,865   \\n1,638   \\n1,726   \\nWorkforce rebalancing charges \\n \\n35   \\n887   \\n158   \\nRD&E and Other (income) and expense \\n \\n80   \\n124   \\n116   \\nIncome from discontinued operations before income taxes \\n \\n$\t1,744   \\n$\t2,142   \\n$\t2,954   \\nProvision for income taxes \\n \\n714  ** \\n484   \\n670   \\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax?? \\n \\n \\n \t \\n$\t1,030    \t \\n$\t1,658     \\n$\t2,285   \\n \\n* Excludes intercompany transactions between IBM and Kyndryl and general corporate overhead costs transferred to Kyndryl as discussed above. ** Includes tax charges related to the Kyndryl separation. \\n?

Hybrid Cloud Revenue by Segment \\n \\nRemaining Performance Obligations \\nThe remaining performance obligation (RPO) disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. It is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts in which the customer is not committed, such as certain as-a-Service, governmental, term software license and services offerings. The customer is not considered committed when they are able to terminate for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty. The disclosure includes estimates of variable consideration, except when the variable consideration is a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company does not include contracts that have an original duration of one year or less. RPO estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency. \\nAt December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to RPO related to customer contracts that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was $62 billion. Approximately 68 percent of the amount is expected to be recognized as revenue in the subsequent two years, approximately 28 percent in the subsequent three to five years and the balance thereafter. \\nRevenue Recognized for Performance Obligations Satisfied (or Partially Satisfied) in Prior Periods \\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue was reduced by $61 million for performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods mainly due to changes in estimates on contracts with cost-to-cost measures of progress. Refer to note A, ÒSignificant Accounting Policies,Ó for additional information on these contracts and estimates of costs to complete. \\nReconciliation of Contract Balances \\nThe following table provides information about notes and accounts receivableÑtrade, contract assets and deferred income balances. \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n($ in millions) \t     \t \t     \t \\nAt December 31: \\n     \\n2021      \\n2020 \\nNotes and accounts receivableÑtrade (net of allowances of $218 in 2021 and $260 in 2020) \\n \\n$ 6,754   \\n$ 5,790  \\nContract assets* \\n \\n  \t471   \\n  \t425  \\nDeferred income (current) \\n \\n  12,518   \\n  11,980  \\n Deferred income (noncurrent) \\n  \\n    3,577    \\n    3,758  \\n* Included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \\n \\nThe amount of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 that was included within the deferred income balance at December 31, 2020 was $10.2 billion and primarily related to services and software. \\nThe following table provides roll forwards of the notes and accounts receivableÑtrade allowance for expected credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n($ in millions) \t \\nJanuary 1, 2021     \tAdditions/(Releases)  \tWrite-offs ?\tOther * \tDecember 31, 2021  \\n$ 260  \t  \t$ (15)  \t$(28)  \t$1    \t$218   \\n  \\nJanuary 1, 2020     \tAdditions/(Releases)  \tWrite-offs ?\tOther * \tDecember 31, 2020  \\n$  235  \t  \t$ 63    \t$(39)  \t$1    \t$260   \\n* Primarily represents translation adjustments. \\n \\nThe contract assets allowance for expected credit losses was not material in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\nDeferred Costs \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n($ in millions) \t     \t \t \t     \t \\nAt December 31: \t     \\n\t2021      \t2020 \\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract \t Deferred costs to fulfill a contract \t \\n$ 476   \t$ 572 \\n  \t \t  \\nDeferred setup costs \t \\n  \t546   \t  \t591 \\n\tOther deferred fulfillment costs \t \t  1,000   \t  1,004  \\nTotal deferred costs* \t \t$ 2,022   \t$ 2,168  \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n* Of the total deferred costs, $1,097 million was current and $924 million was noncurrent at December 31, 2021 and $1,018 million was current and $1,150 million was noncurrent at December 31, 2020. \\n \\nThe amount of total deferred costs amortized during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,872 million and there were no material impairment losses incurred.

SEGMENTS \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, immediately prior to the separation of Kyndryl, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system to align the companyÕs operating model to its platform-centric approach to hybrid cloud and AI. With these changes, the company revised its reportable segments, but did not impact its Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\nThe following table displays the segment updates: \\nPrevious Segments \t     \\nChanges* \t     \\nNew Segments \\nCloud & Cognitive Software \\n?

The segments are determined based on several factors, including client base, homogeneity of products, technology, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics. \\nWith this organizational and management system change, the segments no longer include internal revenue. Certain transactions between the segments are recorded to other income and expense and are reflected in segment pre-tax income. After the Kyndryl separation, these transactions predominately represent loans between Financing and Infrastructure segments to facilitate the acquisition of equipment and software used in IBM IaaS services arrangements. The prior period revenue and pre-tax income presented in the tables below are reported on a comparable basis. \\nThe company utilizes globally integrated support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources. As a result, a considerable amount of expense is shared by all of the segments. This shared expense includes sales coverage, certain marketing functions and support functions such as Accounting, Treasury, Procurement, Legal, Human Resources, and Billing and Collections. Where practical, shared expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense, e.g., headcount. When a clear and measurable driver cannot be identified, shared expenses are allocated on a financial basis that is consistent with the companyÕs management system, e.g., advertising expense is allocated based on the gross profits of the segments. A portion of the shared expenses, which are recorded in net income, are not allocated to the segments. These expenses are associated with the elimination of internal transactions and other miscellaneous items. \\nThe following tables reflect the results of continuing operations of the companyÕs segments consistent with the management and measurement system utilized within the company and have been recast for the prior-year periods due to the companyÕs segment changes in the fourth quarter of 2021. Performance measurement is based on pre-tax income from continuing operations, consistent with the companyÕs management and measurement system. These results are used, by the chief operating decision maker, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments. \\nManagement System Segment View \\n \\n($ in millions) \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n \\n  \t  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nTotal  \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n     Software  \\nConsulting      \\nInfrastructure      \\nFinancing      \\nSegments  \\n2021 \\n  \t \\n \t \\n \t \t \\n \t \\n  \t \\nRevenue \\n  $24,141  \\n$17,844  \\n$ 14,188  \\n$\t774  \\n$56,946  \\nPre-tax income from continuing operations \\n  \t4,722  \\n1,449  \\n 2,025  \\n441  \\n8,637  \\nRevenue year-to-year change \\n   \t5.3  %     \\n  \t9.8  % \\n\t \t(2.4)% \\n(20.6)%     \\n  \t4.1  % \\nPre-tax income year-to-year change \\n   \t41.3  %   \\n  \t40.1  % \\n\t \t22.4  % \\n(1.8)%   \\n  \t33.3  % \\nPre-tax income margin \\n   \t19.6  %   \\n  \t8.1  % \\n\t \t14.3  % \\n57.0  %   \\n  \t15.2  % \\n2020* \\n  \t \\n \t \\n \t \\n \\n \t \\nRevenue \\n  $22,927  \\n$16,257  \\n$ 14,533  \\n$\t975  \\n$54,691  \\nPre-tax income from continuing operations** \\n  \t3,341  \\n1,034  \\n 1,654  \\n449  \\n6,479  \\nRevenue year-to-year change \\n   \t2.3  % \\n  \t(4.0)% \\n\t \t(7.9)% \\n(19.8)%     \\n  \t(2.9)% \\nPre-tax income year-to-year change \\n   \t(33.5)% \\n  \t(23.0)% \\n (33.3)% \\n(31.2)%   \\n  \t(31.8)% \\nPre-tax income margin \\n   \t14.6  % \\n  \t6.4  % \\n\t \t11.4  % \\n46.1  %   \\n  \t11.8  % \\n2019* \\n  \t \\n \t \\n \t \\n \\n \t \\nRevenue \\n  $22,408  \\n$16,939  \\n$ 15,774  \\n$ 1,215  \\n$56,336  \\nPre-tax income from continuing operations \\n \\n   \t5,025  \\n \t \t \t \\n \t1,344  \\n \t \t \\n\t  2,481   \t \\n\t \t652   \\n \t9,502  \\n \t \t \\n*   Recast to conform to 2021 presentation. \\n** Includes the impact of a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Consulting assets are primarily goodwill and accounts receivable. Infrastructure assets are primarily goodwill, plant, property and equipment, and manufacturing inventory. Financing assets are primarily financing receivables, and cash and marketable securities. \\nTo ensure the efficient use of the companyÕs space and equipment, several segments may share leased or owned plant, property and equipment assets. Where assets are shared, landlord ownership of the assets is assigned to one segment and is not allocated to each user segment. This is consistent with the companyÕs management system and is reflected accordingly in the table below. In those cases, there will not be a precise correlation between segment pre-tax income and segment assets. \\nDepreciation expense and capital expenditures that are reported by each segment also are consistent with the landlord ownership basis of asset assignment. \\nFinancing amounts for interest income reflect the income associated with Financing\\'s external client transactions, as well as the income from investment in cash and marketable securities. Financing amounts for interest expense reflect the expense associated with the arm\\'s length terms of the intercompany loans supporting Financing\\'s external client transactions. Intercompany financing activities are recorded to other income and expense and are reflected in segment pre-tax income. \\nManagement System Segment View \\n($ in millions) \\n \t \t \t \\n \t \t \\n \t \t \\n \t \t \\n \t \t  \\n \\n \t \\n \\n \t \t \\n \\nTotal   \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n     Software      \\nConsulting      \\nInfrastructure      \\nFinancing      \\nSegments  \\n2021 \\n \t \t \\n \t \\n \t \\n \t \\n \t \\nAssets \\n  $59,336  \\n$11,914  \\n$ 11,766  \\n$16,880  \\n$ 99,896  \\nDepreciation/amortization of intangibles** \\n \t \t1,204  \\n \t250  \\n 1,399  \\n \t49  \\n \t2,902  \\nCapital expenditures/investments in intangibles \\n \t \t565  \\n \t55  \\n\t \t792  \\n \t33  \\n \t1,444  \\nInterest income \\n \t \tÑ  \\n \tÑ  \\n\t \tÑ  \\n \t628  \\n \t628  \\nInterest expense \\n \t \tÑ  \\n \tÑ  \\n\t \tÑ  \\n \t129  \\n \t129  \\n2020* \\n \t \t \\n \t \\n \t \\n \t \\n \t \\nAssets \\n  $58,558  \\n$10,548  \\n$ 12,378  \\n$24,974  \\n$106,458  \\nDepreciation/amortization of intangibles** \\n \t \t1,237  \\n \t207  \\n 1,419  \\n \t120  \\n \t2,983  \\nCapital expenditures/investments in intangibles \\n \t \t548  \\n \t26  \\n 1,093  \\n \t41  \\n \t1,709  \\nInterest income \\n \t \tÑ  \\n \tÑ  \\n\t \tÑ  \\n \t834  \\n \t834  \\nInterest expense \\n \t \tÑ  \\n \tÑ  \\n\t \tÑ  \\n \t307  \\n \t307  \\n2019* \\n \t \t \\n \t \\n \t \\n \t \\n \t \\nAssets \\n  $58,230  \\n$10,421  \\n$ 12,002  \\n$29,460  \\n$110,113  \\nDepreciation/amortization of intangibles** \\n \t \t676  \\n \t179  \\n 1,348  \\n \t186  \\n \t2,389  \\nCapital expenditures/investments in intangibles \\n \t \t517  \\n \t45  \\n\t \t612  \\n \t57  \\n \t1,230  \\nInterest income \\n \t \tÑ  \\n \tÑ  \\n\t \tÑ  \\n \t1,133  \\n \t1,133  \\nInterest expense  \\n* Recast to conform to 2021 presentation. \\n  \t   \tÑ   \\n  \t \tÑ   \\n\t  \tÑ   \\n   \t512   \\n   \t512   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n** Segment pre-tax income from continuing operations does not include the amortization of acquired intangible assets. \\nReconciliations of IBM as Reported \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \t \t \t \t \\n \t \\n \\n \t \t \\n($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \\n \\n \t \\n \t \t  \\nAt December 31: \t     \t2021      \\n\\n2020 * \\n2019 * \\nAssets \t \t \t \\n \t \\n \t \\nTotal reportable segments \t  \t$ 99,896  \\n$106,458  \\n$ 110,113  \\nElimination of internal transactions \t \t \t(1,608) \\n \t(4,686) \\n \t(4,317) \\nOtherÑdivested businesses  \t \t \t193  \\n \t254  \\n \t1,942  \\nUnallocated amounts \t \t \t \\n \t \\n \t \\n\tCash and marketable securities \t \t \t6,222  \\n \t12,463  \\n \t7,271  \\n\tNotes and accounts receivable \t \t \t1,622  \\n \t1,655  \\n \t1,601  \\n\tDeferred tax assets \t \t \t7,158  \\n \t8,175  \\n \t4,917  \\n\tPlant, other property and equipment \t \t \t2,196  \\n \t2,449  \\n \t2,488  \\n\tOperating right-of-use assets \t \t \t1,945  \\n \t2,368  \\n \t2,531  \\n\tPension assets \t \t \t9,848  \\n \t7,557  \\n \t6,819  \\nOther \t \t \t4,530  \\nTotal assets of discontinued operations** \t \t \tÑ  \\n \t3,514  \\n \t15,764  \\n \t3,184  \\n \t15,638  \\nTotal IBM consolidated assets \t  \t$ 132,001  \\n \t \t \t \t \\n$155,971  \\n \t \t \\n$ 152,186  \\n \t \t \\n* Recast to conform to 2021 presentation. \\n** Refer to note C, ÒSeparation of Kyndryl,Ó for additional information. \\nMajor Clients \\nNo single client represented 10 percent or more of the companyÕs total revenue in 2021, 2020 or 2019. \\n \\nGeographic Information \\nThe following tables provide information for those countries that are 10 percent or more of the specific category. \\nRevenue? \\n($ in millions) \\nFor the year ended December 31: \\n \\n     \\n \t \t \\n2021      \\n \t \t \\n2020 * \\n \t  \t \\n2019 * \\nUnited States \\n  \\n$22,893  \\n$22,258  \\n$23,389  \\nJapan \\n \\n \t5,648  \\n5,680  \\n5,755  \\nOther countries \\n \\n 28,810  \\n27,241  \\n28,570  \\nTotal revenue \\n \\n?

These items also reflect audit settlements or changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with each of these items. \\nThe continuing operations effective rate for 2021 was 2.6 percent compared to (52.9) percent in 2020. The current-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by tax benefits related to audit settlements in multiple jurisdictions. The prior-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by an intra-entity sale of certain of the companyÕs intellectual property in the first quarter of 2020 which required the recognition of a $3.4 billion deferred tax asset. The recognition of this non-U.S. deferred tax asset and its related GILTI impacts in the U.S. resulted in a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, a change in foreign tax law resulted in a $0.2 billion tax benefit in the prior year. \\nThe effect of tax law changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on the companyÕs 2021 effective tax rate. \\nDeferred Tax Assets \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t  \\nAt December 31: \\n     \\n2021      \\n2020  \\nRetirement benefits \\n  \\n$ 3,142  \\n$ 3,700  \\nLeases \\n \\n \t1,061  \\n \t1,149  \\nShare-based and other compensation \\n \\n \t661  \\n \t579  \\nDomestic tax loss/credit carryforwards \\n \\n \t1,619  \\n \t1,746  \\nDeferred income \\n \\n \t630  \\n \t661  \\nForeign tax loss/credit carryforwards \\n \\n \t983  \\n \t818  \\nBad debt, inventory and warranty reserves \\n \\n \t390  \\n \t324  \\nDepreciation \\n \\n \t249  \\n \t139  \\nHedging losses \\n \\n \t26  \\n \t576  \\nRestructuring charges \\n \\n \t216  \\n \t253  \\nAccruals \\n \\n \t305  \\n \t483  \\nIntangible assets \\n \\n \t2,929  \\n \t3,540  \\nCapitalized research and development \\n \\n \t2,161  \\n \t1,387  \\nOther \\n \\n \t1,280  \\n \t1,352  \\nGross deferred tax assets \\n \\n 15,652  \\n 16,707  \\nLess: valuation allowance \\n \\n \t883  \\n \t850  \\nNet deferred tax assets \\n \\n  \\n \\n$ 14,769  \\n \t \\n$ 15,857  \\n \t \\n* \\nDeferred Tax Liabilities \\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions) \\n \\n \\n \\nAt December 31: \\n     \\n2021      \\n2020      \\nGoodwill and intangible assets \\n  \\n$ 2,290  \\n$ 2,635  \\nGILTI deferred taxes \\n \\n \t3,257  \\n \t4,119  \\nLeases and right-of-use assets \\n \\n \t1,314  \\n \t1,584  \\nDepreciation \\n \\n \t518  \\n \t646  \\nRetirement benefits \\n \\n \t1,971  \\n \t1,209  \\nSoftware development costs \\n \\n \t1,016  \\n \t1,007  \\nDeferred transition costs \\n \\n \t42  \\n \t200  \\nUndistributed foreign earnings \\n \\n \t131  \\n \t276  \\nOther \\n \\n \t817  \\n \t734  \\nGross deferred tax liabilities \\n \\n  \\n \\n$ 11,356  \\n \\n$ 12,410  \\n \\n \\nFor financial reporting purposes, the company had foreign and domestic loss carryforwards, the tax effect of which was $773 million, as well as foreign and domestic credit carryforwards of $1,829 million.

The amounts principally apply to certain foreign and domestic loss carryforwards and credits. In the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. However, to the extent that tax benefits related to these carryforwards are realized in the future, the reduction in the valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense. \\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021 increased by $141 million in 2021 to $8,709 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: \\n($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n \\n \\n2021      \\n2020      \\n2019 \\nBalance at January 1 \\n \\n$ 8,568  \\n$ 7,146  \\n$ 6,759  \\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year \\n \\n \t934  \\n 1,690  \\n \t816  \\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years \\n \\n \t247  \\n \t159  \\n \t779  \\nReductions for tax positions of prior years (including impacts due to a lapse of statute) \\n \\n \t(688) \\n \t(408) \\n \t(922) \\nSettlements \\n \\n \t(352) \\n \t(19) \\n \t(286) \\nBalance at December 31 \\n \\n \\n \\n$ 8,709  \\n \t \\n$ 8,568  \\n \t \\n$ 7,146  \\n \\nThe additions to unrecognized tax benefits related to the current and prior years were primarily attributable to non-U.S. tax matters, including transfer pricing, as well as U.S. federal and state tax matters, credits and incentives. The settlements and reductions to unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions of prior years were primarily attributable to non-U.S. audits, U.S. federal and state tax matters, impacts due to lapse of statute of limitations and foreign currency translation adjustments. \\nThe unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021 of $8,709 million can be reduced by $546 million associated with timing adjustments, U.S. tax credits, potential transfer pricing adjustments and state income taxes. The net amount of $8,163 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the companyÕs effective tax rate. The net amounts at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $7,994 million and $6,562 million, respectively. \\nInterest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the company recognized $125 million in interest expense and penalties; in 2020, the company recognized $117 million in interest expense and penalties; and, in 2019, the company recognized $13 million in interest expense and penalties. The company had $935 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2021, and had $843 million accrued at December 31, 2020. \\nWithin the next 12 months, the company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with certain positions may be reduced. The potential decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is associated with certain non-U.S. positions that are expected to be recognized due to a lapse in statute of limitations, as well as anticipated resolution of various non-U.S. audits. The company estimates that the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021 could be reduced by $166 million. \\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its examination of the companyÕs U.S. income tax returns for 2013 and 2014, which had a specific focus on certain cross-border transactions that occurred in 2013 and issued a final Revenue AgentÕs Report (RAR). The IRSÕ proposed adjustments relative to these cross-border transactions, if sustained, would result in additional taxable income of approximately $4.5 billion. The company strongly disagrees with the IRS on these specific matters and filed its IRS Appeals protest in the first quarter of 2021. In the third quarter of 2018, the IRS commenced its audit of the companyÕs U.S. tax returns for 2015 and 2016. The company anticipates that this audit will be completed in 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the IRS commenced its audit of the companyÕs U.S. tax returns for 2017 and 2018. With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2015. The company is no longer subject to income tax examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years prior to 2013. The open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions, and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years. \\nThe company is involved in a number of income tax-related matters in India challenging tax assessments issued by the India Tax Authorities. As of December 31, 2021, the company had recorded $727 million as prepaid income taxes in India. A significant portion of this balance represents cash tax deposits paid over time to protect the companyÕs right to appeal various income tax assessments made by the India Tax Authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits are always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years.   \\nWithin consolidated retained earnings at December 31, 2021 were undistributed after-tax earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that were not indefinitely reinvested. At December 31, 2021, the company had a deferred tax liability of $131 million for the estimated taxes associated with the repatriation of these earnings. Quantification of the deferred tax liability associated with indefinitely reinvested non-earnings related outside basis differences, if any, was not practicable. \\nNOTE I.

The company accounts for the Kyndryl shares as a fair value investment. The fair value of the shares at December 31, 2021 of $807 million is included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. An unrealized gain of $126 million representing the difference between the book value of the Kyndryl shares as of the date of separation and the fair value of the shares as of December 31, 2021 was recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to note C, ÒSeparation of Kyndryl,Ó for additional information. \\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value \\nShort-Term Receivables and Payables \\nNotes and other accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt and including shortterm finance lease liabilities) are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for short-term debt which would be classified as Level 2. \\nLoans and Long-Term Receivables \\nFair values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. \\nLong-Term Debt \\nFair value of publicly traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other long-term debt (including long-term finance lease liabilities) for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was $44,917 million and $54,217 million, and the estimated fair value was $49,465 million and $61,460 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. NOTE K.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES \\nFinancing receivables primarily consist of client loan and installment payment receivables (loans) and investment in sales-type and direct financing leases (collectively referred to as client financing receivables) and commercial financing receivables. Loans are provided primarily to clients to finance the purchase of hardware, software and services. Payment terms on these financing arrangements are generally for terms up to seven years. Investment in sales-type and direct financing leases relate principally to the companyÕs Infrastructure products and are for terms ranging generally from two to six years. Commercial financing receivables, which consist of both held-for-investment and held-for-sale receivables, relate primarily to working capital financing for dealers and remarketers of IBM products. Payment terms for working capital financing generally range from 30 to 90 days.  \\nA summary of the components of the companyÕs financing receivables is presented as follows: \\n($ in millions) \\n     \t \t     \t    \t \t     \t \t \t \t \t     \\n    \t \\n \\n \\n \tClient Financing Receivables \t \tCommercial Financing Receivables \\n \tClient Loan and  \tInvestment in  \t \t \\n \\n \\n \\n \tInstallment Payment  \tSales-Type and  \t \t \\n \\n \\n \tReceivables/  \tDirect Financing  \tHeld for  \tHeld for  \\n \\nAt December 31, 2021: \\n \\n\t(Loans) \t \tLeases \t \tInvestment \tSale * \\nTotal \\nFinancing receivables, gross \\n \\n\t$9,303  \t$3,336  \t$450  \t$793  \\n$13,881  \\nUnearned income \\n \\n\t (353) \t (223) \t \tÑ  \t \tÑ  \\n \t(576)\\nResidual value** \\n \\n\t \tÑ  \t \t335  \t \tÑ  \t \tÑ  \\n \t335  \\nAmortized cost \\n \\n\t$8,949  \t$3,448  \t$450  \t$793  \\n$13,640  \\nAllowance for credit losses \\n \\n\t (131) \t \t(64) \t \t(6) \t \tÑ  \\n \t(201)\\nTotal financing receivables, net \\n \\n\t$8,818  \t$3,384  \t$444  \t$793  \\n$13,439  \\nCurrent portion \\n \\n\t$5,371  \t$1,406  \t$444  \t$793  \\n$ 8,014  \\nNoncurrent portion \\n \\n \\n \\n\t$3,447  \t$1,978  \t$\tÑ  \t$\tÑ  \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n$ 5,425  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n($ in millions) \\n     \\n \t     \t    \t \t     \t \t \t \t \t     \\n    \t \\n  \\n  \\n\tClient Financing Receivables \t Commercial Financing Receivables? \t \\n\tClient Loan and \t \tInvestment in  \t \t \\n  \\n \\n \\nInstallment Payment \t \tSales-Type and  \t \t \\n \\n \\n \\n\tReceivables/ \t \tDirect Financing  \tHeld for  \tHeld for \t \\n \\nAt December 31, 2020: \\n \\n\t(Loans) \t \tLeases  \tInvestment \tSale * \\nTotal \\nFinancing receivables, gross \\n \\n\t$12,159  \t$4,001  \t$2,036  \t$383  \\n$18,580  \\nUnearned income \\n \\n\t(488) \t(335) \t0  \tÑ  \\n(823)\\nResidual value** \\n \\n\t \tÑ  \t \t485  \t \tÑ  \t \tÑ  \\n \t485  \\nAmortized cost \\n \\n\t$11,671  \t$4,151  \t$2,036  \t$383  \\n$18,242  \\nAllowance for credit losses \\n \\n\t \t(173) \t \t(82) \t \t(8) \t \tÑ  \\n \t(263)\\nTotal financing receivables, net \\n \\n\t$11,498  \t$4,069  \t$2,028  \t$383  \\n$17,979  \\nCurrent portion \\n \\n\t$ 6,955  \t$1,525  \t$2,028  \t$383  \\n$10,892  \\nNoncurrent portion \\n \\n \\n \\n\t$ 4,542  \t$2,544  \t$\tÑ  \t$\tÑ  \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n$ 7,086  \\n*  The carrying value of the receivables classified as held for sale approximates fair value. \\n**  Includes guaranteed and unguaranteed residual value. \\n+  Recast to conform to 2021 presentation. \\nThe company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigation actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties. These actions may include credit insurance, financial guarantees, nonrecourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Sale of receivables arrangements are also utilized in the normal course of business as part of the companyÕs cash and liquidity management.  \\nFinancing receivables pledged as collateral for nonrecourse borrowings were $408 million and $482 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

In addition, on December 24, 2020, the company entered into an agreement with a third-party investor to sell up to $3.0 billion of IBM short-term commercial financing receivables, at any one time, on a revolving basis, starting in the U.S. and Canada in 2020, and expanding to other countries within Europe  and Asia Pacific in 2021, including Germany and the UK. \\nThe following table presents the total amount of client and commercial financing receivables transferred: \\n( $ in millions) \t      \t \\n \t \t      \t \t \\n \\n   \t \\n \t \\nClient financing receivables for the year ended December 31 \t \t \\n2021  \\n \\n2020 \\n\tLease receivables \t \\n$\t819  \\n$1,152 \\n\tLoan receivables \t \\n 2,224  \\n 1,410 \\nTotal client financing receivables transferred* \t \\nCommercial financing receivables \t \\n$3,043  \\n \\n$2,562 \\nReceivables transferred for the year ended December 31 \t Receivables transferred and uncollected as of December 31** \t \\n$7,359  1,653  \\n$\t515 \\n510 \\n*   More than half of the client financing receivables sold were classified as current assets at the time of sale. \\n** Of the total amount of commercial financing receivables sold and derecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the amounts presented remained uncollected from business partners as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\n \\nThe transfer of these receivables qualified as true sales and therefore reduced financing receivables.

Financing income recognized on these receivables was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \\nCredit Quality Indicators \\nThe companyÕs credit quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to MoodyÕs Investors Service credit ratings as shown below. The company uses information provided by MoodyÕs, where available, as one of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings. The credit quality of the customer is evaluated based on these indicators and is assigned the same risk rating whether the receivable is a lease or a loan. \\nThe following tables present the amortized cost basis for client financing receivables by credit quality indicator at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Receivables with a credit quality indicator ranging from Aaa to Baa3 are considered investment grade. All others are considered non-investment grade. The credit quality indicators reflect mitigating credit enhancement actions taken by customers which reduce the risk to IBM. \\n($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \\n \t \tAmericas \t \tEMEA \t \tAsia Pacific \\nAt December 31, 2021: \t    \\n Aaa - Baa3      \tBa1 - D      \\nAaa - Baa3      \\nBa1 - D      \\nAaa - Baa3      \tBa1 - D \\nVintage year \t  \\n\t2021 \t \\n \t    \t \t    \\n\t$2,556  \t$ 1,147  \\n \t    \\n$ 1,181  \\n \t    \t \\n$\t778  \\n          \t \t  $\t565  \t$226 \\n\t2020 \t \\n\t1,013  \t \t392  \\n 506  \\n\t342  \t \\n381  \\n86 \\n\t2019 \t \\n\t544  \t \t236  \\n 287  \\n\t291  \t \\n297  \\n51 \\n\t2018 \t \\n\t338  \t \t117  \\n 189  \\n\t85  \t \\n211  \\n64 \\n\t2017 \t \\n\t108  \t \t50  \\n\t \t15  \\n\t52  \t \\n74  \\n17 \\n\t2016 and prior \t \t20  \t \t53  \t \t21  \t46  \t \t38  \t20  \\nTotal \t \t$4,579  \t$ 1,994  \t$ 2,198  \t$1,595  \t$1,567  \t$464  \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n \\n\t($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \\n\t \t \tAmericas \t \tEMEA \t \tAsia Pacific \\nAt December 31, 2020: \t    \\n Aaa - Baa3      \\nBa1 - D      \\nAaa - Baa3      \\nBa1 - D      \\nAaa - Baa3      \\nBa1 - D \\nVintage year \t  \\n\t2020 \t \\n \t    \\n$2,818  \\n \t    \\n$ 1,449  \\n \t    \\n$ 1,513  \\n \t    \t \\n$1,427  \\n    \\n\t$\t958  \\n \t  \\n$351 \\n\t2019 \t \\n988  \\n \t623  \\n 668  \\n\t519  \t \\n564  \\n123 \\n\t2018 \t \\n829  \\n \t360  \\n 329  \\n\t245  \t \\n419  \\n167 \\n\t2017 \t \\n285  \\n \t154  \\n\t \t70  \\n\t128  \t \\n205  \\n52 \\n\t2016 \t \\n90  \\n \t52  \\n\t \t33  \\n\t46  \t \\n114  \\n33 \\n\t2015 and prior \t \\n28  \\n \t81  \\n\t \t22  \\n\t22  \t \\n38  \\n18 \\n\tTotal \t \t$5,038  \t$ 2,720  \t$ 2,635  \t$2,387  \t$2,298  \t$743  \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n \\nTroubled Debt Restructurings \\nThe company did not have any significant troubled debt restructurings for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\nNOTE M.

In addition, in 2021 and 2020, respectively, the company retired $904 million and $1,461 million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.  \\nThe future amortization expense relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is estimated to be the following at December 31, 2021: \\n \\n \t \\n \t \t \\n \t \\n \t \\n \\n     \\nCapitalized      \\nAcquired      \\n \\n($ in millions) \\n \\nSoftware  \\nIntangibles  \\nTotal \\n2022 \\n \\n$512   \\n$1,818   \\n$ 2,329  \\n2023 \\n \\n 313   \\n 1,513   \\n  1,826  \\n2024 \\n \\n 120   \\n 1,467   \\n  1,587  \\n2025 \\n \\n\t \t0   \\n 1,450   \\n  1,450  \\n2026 \\n \\n\t \t0   \\n 1,433   \\n  1,433  \\nThereafter \\n \\n \\n \\n\t \tÑ   \\n \t \\n 3,886   \\n \t \\n  3,886  \\n \\n \\nGoodwill \\nThe changes in the goodwill balances by reportable segment, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows: \\n($ in millions) \\n \\n     \t \t     \t \t     \t \t     \t \t     \t \t   \t \t  \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tForeign  \t \t \\n \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tCurrency  \t \t  \\n \\n \t \t \t \tPurchase  \t \t \tTranslation  \t  \\n \\n \tBalance at  \tGoodwill  \tPrice  \t \t \tand Other  \tBalance at      \\nSegment* \\n \tJanuary 1, 2021  \tAdditions  \tAdjustments  \t         Divestitures  \tAdjustments **       December 31, 2021   \\nSoftware \\n \t$43,149   \t$1,836   \t$\t23   \t$(13) \t$(545) \t$44,450   \\nConsulting \\n \\n\t 6,145   \t \t713   \t (21) \t \tÑ   \t (40) \t 6,797   \\nInfrastructure \\n \\n\t 4,436   \t \tÑ   \t \t0   \t \tÑ   \t (39) \t 4,396   \\nOtherÑdivested businesses \\n \\n\t \t36   \t \tÑ   \t \tÑ   \t (37) \t \t1   \t \tÑ   \\nTotal \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\t$53,765   \t$2,549   \t$\t2   \t$(50) \t$(623) \t$55,643   \\n \t \t \t \t \t \\n($ in millions) \\n \\n\\n     \t \t     \t \t     \t \t     \t      \t \t     \t \t  \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tForeign \t \t \t \\n \\n\\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \tCurrency \t \t \t  \\n \\n\\n \t \t \t \tPurchase  \t  \tTranslation  \t  \\n \\n\\n \tBalance at  \tGoodwill  \tPrice  \t  \tand Other      \tBalance at      \\nSegment* \\n\\n January 1, 2020  \tAdditions  \tAdjustments  \tDivestitures  \tAdjustments **       December 31, 2020    \\nSoftware \\n\\n \t$42,275   \t$362   \t$(139) \t$ Ñ   \t$651   \t$43,149   \\nConsulting \\n\\n \t 5,775   \t 205   \t \tÑ   \t Ñ   \t 165   \t 6,145   \\nInfrastructure \\n\\n \t 4,386   \t \t8   \t \tÑ   \t Ñ   \t 42   \t 4,436   \\nOtherÑdivested businesses \\n\\n \t \t35   \t \tÑ   \t \tÑ   \t Ñ   \t \t1   \t \t36   \\nTotal \\n \\n\\n \t$52,471   \t$575   \t$(139) \t$ Ñ   \t$859   \t$53,765   \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n* Recast to reflect segment changes. \\n** Primarily driven by foreign currency translation. \\nThe company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2021. Following the changes to the organizational structure, goodwill was reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach. As a result, the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for all affected reporting units.  \\nThere were no goodwill impairment losses recorded during 2021 or 2020 and the company has no accumulated impairment losses. \\nPurchase price adjustments recorded in 2021 and 2020 were related to acquisitions that were still subject to the measurement period that ends at the earlier of 12 months from the acquisition date or when information becomes available. Net purchase price adjustments recorded in 2021 were not material. During 2020, net purchase price adjustments recorded to noncurrent tax assets and liabilities were related to the Red Hat acquisition. \\nNOTE P.

The credit facilities also include a covenant on the companyÕs consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. \\nThe company is in compliance with all of its debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders. The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable. \\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the company issued an aggregate of $4.1 billion of Euro fixed-rate notes and the proceeds were primarily used to early redeem outstanding fixed-rate debt which was due in 2021 in the aggregate amount of $2.9 billion. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal plus a make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company incurred a loss of $49 million upon redemption that was recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nIn the first quarter of 2021, IBM Credit LLC early redeemed all of its outstanding fixed-rate debt in the aggregate amount of $1.75 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2023 and deregistered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal plus a make-whole premium and accrued interest. The company incurred a loss of approximately $22 million upon redemption that was recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. \\nPost-Swap Borrowing (Long-Term Debt, Including Current Portion) \\n\t($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n \t \t \t  \t \t \t \tWeighted-Average  \t \t \tWeighted-Average  For the year ended December 31: \t      \tAmount       \tInterest Rate  \tAmount       \tInterest Rate  \\nFixed-rate debt  $ 49,976   2.8 %   $ 53,237   2.7 % Floating-rate debt*    1,705    2.6 %   7,966    1.1 % \\n\tTotal \t \t$ 51,681   \t \t$ 61,203   \t \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n* Includes $425 million and $2,975 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, of notional interest-rate swaps that effectively convert fixed-rate long-term debt into floating-rate debt.

The maturity dates for the new ThreeYear and Five-Year Credit Agreements (the Credit Agreements) are June 21, 2024, and June 22, 2026, respectively. The Credit Agreements permit the company and its subsidiary borrowers to borrow up to $10 billion on a revolving basis. In connection with entering into the Credit Agreements, the company also terminated its $2.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement which was scheduled to expire on July 1, 2021. The total expense recorded by the company related to these agreements was $12 million, $12 million and $9 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreements, the borrower may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the Credit Agreements at any time during the term of such agreements. Funds borrowed may be used for the general corporate purposes of the borrower. \\nInterest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreements will be based on prevailing market interest rates, as further described in the Credit Agreements. The Credit Agreements contain customary representations and warranties, covenants, events of default, and indemnification provisions. The company believes that circumstances that might give rise to breach of these covenants or an event of default, as specified in the Credit Agreements, are remote. The company also has other committed lines of credit in some of the geographies which are not significant in the aggregate. Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions. \\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were no borrowings by the company, or its subsidiaries, under these credit facilities. \\nNOTE R.

The noncurrent contractually obligated future payments associated with these activities are reflected in the workforce reductions caption in the previous table. The noncurrent liabilities are workforce accruals primarily related to terminated employees who are no longer working for the company who were granted annual payments to supplement their incomes in certain countries. Depending on the individual countryÕs legal requirements, these required payments will continue until the former employee begins receiving pension benefits or passes away. The total amounts accrued for workforce reductions, including amounts classified as other accrued expenses and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, were $1,359 million and $2,631 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease is  primarily due to cash payments made in 2021 for the workforce reduction action in the fourth quarter of 2020 for which the company recorded a charge of $1,472 million in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Income Statement for severance and employee related benefits in accordance with the accounting guidance for ongoing benefit arrangements. \\nThe company employs extensive internal environmental protection programs that primarily are preventive in nature. The company also participates in environmental assessments and cleanups at a number of locations, including operating facilities, previously owned facilities and Superfund sites. The companyÕs maximum exposure for all environmental liabilities cannot be estimated and no amounts have been recorded for non-ARO environmental liabilities that are not probable or estimable. The total amounts accrued for non-ARO environmental liabilities, including amounts classified as current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, that do not reflect actual or anticipated insurance recoveries, were $248 million and $266 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of the companyÕs operations in future periods. However, estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation regulations. \\nAs of December 31, 2021, the company was unable to estimate the range of settlement dates and the related probabilities for certain asbestos remediation AROs. These conditional AROs are primarily related to the encapsulated structural fireproofing that is not subject to abatement unless the buildings are demolished and non-encapsulated asbestos that the company would remediate only if it performed major renovations of certain existing buildings. Because these conditional obligations have indeterminate settlement dates, the company could not develop a reasonable estimate of their fair values. The company will continue to assess its ability to estimate fair values at each future reporting date. The related liability will be recognized once sufficient additional information becomes available. The total amounts accrued for ARO liabilities, including amounts classified as current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, were $119 million and $122 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \\nNOTE S. COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES \\nCommitments \\nThe companyÕs extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the companyÕs business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The company collectively evaluates the allowance for these arrangements using a provision methodology consistent with the portfolio of the commitments. Refer to note A, ÒSignificant Accounting Policies,Ó for additional information. The allowance for these commitments is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was not material at December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\nThe company has applied the guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantorÕs performance is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor. \\nThe company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the assets sold, certain intellectual property rights, specified environmental matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow the company to challenge the other partyÕs claims. While indemnification provisions typically do not include a contractual maximum on the companyÕs payment, the companyÕs obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company. \\nIt is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the companyÕs obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on the companyÕs business, financial condition or results of operations.  \\nIn addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees and the fair value of these guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was not material. \\nChanges in the companyÕs warranty liability for standard warranties, which are included in other accrued expenses and liabilities and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and for extended warranty contracts, which are included in deferred income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are presented in the following tables. \\nStandard Warranty Liability \\n\t( $ in millions) \t      \t \t \t      \t \t \\n\t \t     \t2021      \t2020 \\n\tBalance at January 1 \t \t$ 83  \t$113  \\n\tCurrent period accruals \t \t 82  \t \t83  \\n\tAccrual adjustments to reflect experience \t \t \t(1) \t (16)\\n\tCharges incurred \t \t (86) \t (96)\\n\tBalance at December 31  \t  \t$  \t77   \t$ 83  \t \\n \\n \t \\nExtended Warranty Liability (Deferred Income) \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n($ in millions) \t     \t \t     \t \\n     \t2021      \t2020 \\nBalance at January 1 \\n \\n$ 425  \\n$ 477  \\nRevenue deferred for new extended warranty contracts \\n \\n 133  \\n 166  \\nAmortization of deferred revenue \\n \\n (198) \\n (224)\\nOther* \\n \\n \t(10) \\n \t6  \\nBalance at December 31 \\n \\n$ 350  \\n$ 425  \\nCurrent portion \\n \\n$ 163  \\n$ 204  \\n Noncurrent portion \\n  \\n$  186   \\n$  221  \\n* Other consists primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. \\nContingencies \\nAs a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations, lawsuits or otherwise. Further, given the rapidly evolving external landscape of cybersecurity, privacy and data protection laws, regulations and threat actors, the company and its clients have been and will continue to be subject to actions or proceedings in various jurisdictions. Also, as is typical for companies of IBMÕs scope and scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and employment laws, and the companyÕs pension, retirement and other benefit plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability, securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters arise. \\nThe company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \\nIn accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the company provides disclosures of matters for which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible. In addition, the company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer and employee relations considerations. \\nWith respect to certain of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed herein, the company believes at this time that the likelihood of any material loss is remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court rulings, and/or the strength of the companyÕs defenses in those matters. With respect to the remaining claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed in this note, except as specifically discussed herein, the company is unable to provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses, including losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following reasons. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. It is the companyÕs experience that damage amounts claimed in litigation against it are unreliable and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of the companyÕs potential liability. Further, the company is unable to provide such an estimate due to a number of other factors with respect to these claims, suits, investigations and proceedings, including considerations of the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. The company reviews claims, suits, investigations and proceedings at least quarterly, and decisions are made with respect to recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing reasonably possible losses or range of losses (individually or in the aggregate), to reflect the impact and status of settlement discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive rulings, reviews by counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter. \\nWhether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the companyÕs business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular matter that may give rise to additional factors. While the company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the companyÕs business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these matters. \\nThe following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company. \\nIn December 2017, CIS General Insurance Limited (CISGIL) sued IBM UK regarding a contract entered into by IBM UK and CISGIL in 2015 to implement and operate an IT insurance platform. The contract was terminated by IBM UK in July 2017 for non-payment by CISGIL. CISGIL alleges wrongful termination, breach of contract and breach of warranty. In February 2021, the Technology & Construction Court in London rejected the majority of CISGILÕs claims and ruled in IBMÕs favor on its counterclaim. The courtÕs decision required IBM to pay approximately $20 million in damages, plus interest and litigation costs. CISGIL was granted permission to appeal and the matter is now pending at the Court of Appeal in London.  \\nOn June 8, 2021, IBM sued GlobalFoundries U.S. Inc. (GF) in New York State Supreme Court for claims including fraud and breach of contract relating to a long-term strategic relationship between IBM and GF for researching, developing, and manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips for IBM. GF walked away from its obligations and IBM is now suing to recover amounts paid to GF, and other compensatory and punitive damages, totaling more than $1.5 billion. On September 14, 2021, the court ruled on GFÕs motion to dismiss. IBMÕs claims for breaches of contract and promissory estoppel are proceeding. \\nThe company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as ÒSuperfund,Ó or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or former operating sites. \\nThe company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The total potential amount related to all these matters for all applicable years is approximately $400 million. The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability. \\nNOTE T. EQUITY ACTIVITY \\nThe authorized capital stock of IBM consists of (i) 4,687,500,000 shares of common stock with a $.20 per share par value, of which 898,068,600 shares were outstanding at December 31, 2021, and (ii) 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a $.01 per share par value, whereby 75,000,000 shares have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock, of which 57,916,244 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company but were not outstanding at December 31, 2021. The company does not intend to issue or transfer any shares of Series A Preferred Stock to any third parties.    \\nStock Repurchases \\nThe Board of Directors authorizes the company to repurchase IBM common stock. The company suspended its share repurchase program effective with the close of the Red Hat acquisition on July 9, 2019 in order to focus on reducing debt related to the acquisition. The company repurchased 9,979,516 common shares at a cost of $1,331 million in 2019. Actual cash disbursements for repurchased shares may differ due to varying settlement dates for these transactions. At December 31, 2021, $2,008 million of Board common stock repurchase authorization was available. \\nOther Stock Transactions \\nThe company issued the following shares of common stock as part of its stock-based compensation plans and employees stock purchase plan: 5,608,845 shares in 2021, 4,972,028 shares in 2020, and 4,569,917 shares in 2019. The company issued 2,093,243 treasury shares in 2021, 2,934,907 treasury shares in 2020, and 2,041,347 treasury shares in 2019, as a result of restricted stock unit releases and exercises of stock options by employees of certain acquired businesses and by non-U.S. employees. Also, as part of the companyÕs stock-based compensation plans, 2,286,912 common shares at a cost of $319 million, 2,363,966 common shares at a cost of $302 million, and 2,000,704 common shares at a cost of $272 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were remitted by employees to the company in order to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. These amounts are included in the treasury stock balance in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of Equity. \\n \t \\nReclassifications and Taxes Related to Items of Other Comprehensive Income \\n($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n \t \\nBefore Tax  \\nTax (Expense)/  \\nNet of Tax \\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021: \t     \\nAmount      \\nBenefit      \\nAmount \\nOther comprehensive income/(loss) \t  Foreign currency translation adjustments \t \\n\tNet changes related to available-for-sale securities \t \\n    \\n$\t987     \\n    \\n\t$\t(414) \\n \t   \\n  \\n$\t573 \\n \t  \\n\tUnrealized gains/(losses) arising during the period \t \\n\t$\t0  \\n\t$\t0  \\n$\t0 \\n\tReclassification of (gains)/losses to other (income) and expense \t \\nÑ  \\n\t \tÑ  \\n\t \tÑ \\nTotal net changes related to available-for-sale securities \t Unrealized gains/(losses) on cash flow hedges \t \\n\t$\t0  \\n   \\n$\t0   \t   \\n$\t0 \\n \t  \\n\tUnrealized gains/(losses) arising during the period \t \\n\t$\t344  \\n\t$\t(89) \\n$\t256 \\n\tReclassification of (gains)/losses to: \t \\n   \\n \t   \\n \t  \\n\tCost of services \t \\n(43) \\n\t \t11  \\n\t \t(32)\\n\tCost of sales \t \\n16  \\n\t \t(3) \\n\t \t13 \\n\tCost of financing \t \\n22  \\n\t \t(6) \\n\t \t17 \\n\tSG&A expense \t \\n24  \\n\t \t(6) \\n\t \t19 \\n\tOther (income) and expense \t \\n157  \\n\t \t(40) \\n\t \t118 \\n\tInterest expense \t \\n65  \\n\t \t(16) \\n\t \t49 \\n\tTotal unrealized gains/(losses) on cash flow hedges \t \\n\tRetirement-related benefit plans(1) \t \\n\t$\t587  \\n   \\n\t$\t(149) \\n \t   \\n$\t438 \\n \t  \\n\tPrior service costs/(credits) \t \\n\t$\t(51) \\n\t$\t(1) \\n$\t(52)\\n\tNet (losses)/gains arising during the period \t \\n2,433  \\n(601) \\n1,832 \\n\tCurtailments and settlements \t \\n94  \\n\t \t(11) \\n\t \t83 \\n\tAmortization of prior service (credits)/costs \t \\n9  \\n0  \\n9 \\n\tAmortization of net (gains)/losses \t \\n2,484  \\n\t \t(528) \\n 1,956 \\n\tTotal retirement-related benefit plans \t \\n$4,969  \\n$(1,140) \\n$3,828 \\nOther comprehensive income/(loss) \t \\n \t \\n(1) These AOCI components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\nThe company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements between the interest rates associated with the companyÕs lease and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \\nIn the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments. The amount recognized in other accounts receivable for the right to reclaim cash collateral was $2 million at December 31, 2021 and no amount was recognized at December 31, 2020. The amount recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral at December 31, 2021 was $38 million and no amount was recognized at December 31, 2020. The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2021, $2 million was rehypothecated and no amount was rehypothecated at December 31, 2020. Additionally, if derivative exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement had been netted in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total derivative asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $60 million and $213 million, respectively. \\nIn its hedging programs, the company may use forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, equity swaps and options depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments. \\nA brief description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows. \\nInterest Rate Risk \\nFixed and Variable Rate Borrowings \\nThe company issues debt in the global capital markets to fund its operations and financing business. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company may use interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of the companyÕs interest-rate swaps was $0.4 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. In the first quarter of 2021, in addition to the scheduled swap maturities, the company terminated $1.3 billion of interest-rate swaps concurrent with the early redemption of the underlying hedged fixed-rate debt. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately 1.2 years. These interest-rate contracts were accounted for as fair value hedges. The company did not have any cash flow hedges relating to this program outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\nForecasted Debt Issuance \\nThe company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may use instruments such as forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuances. There were no instruments outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020. \\nIn connection with cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments related to the companyÕs borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $157 million and $174 million (before taxes) at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $18 million (before taxes) of the deferred net losses on derivatives in AOCI at December 31, 2021 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying interest payments. \\nForeign Exchange Risk \\nLong-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment) \\nA large portion of the companyÕs foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholdersÕ equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of debt designated as hedging instruments was $14.1 billion and $16.4 billion, respectively. The company also uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.1 years and 0.3 years, respectively. \\nAnticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions \\nThe companyÕs operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the companyÕs non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2021, the maximum remaining length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately three years. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $7.2 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.6 years and 0.7 years, respectively. \\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains of $315 million and net losses of $192 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $236 million (before taxes) of deferred net gains on derivatives in AOCI at December 31, 2021 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. \\nForeign Currency Denominated Borrowings \\nThe company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2021, the maximum length of time remaining over which the company has hedged its exposure was approximately six years. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.  \\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net losses of $174 million and $236 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $15 million (before taxes) of deferred net losses on derivatives in AOCI at December 31, 2021 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying exposure. \\nSubsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management \\nThe company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the companyÕs nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $6.8 billion. \\nEquity Risk Management \\nThe company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and in the companyÕs own stock primarily related to certain obligations to employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or the total return on the companyÕs common stock, and are recorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. \\nCumulative Basis Adjustments for Fair Value Hedges \\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the following amounts were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges: \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n\t($ in millions) \t \t \t \t \\nAt December 31: \t     \\n2021      \\n2020 \\nShort-term debt \t \\nCarrying amount of the hedged item \t  \\n \t   \\n$(227)  \\n \t

discontinued hedging relationships at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \\nThe Effect of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Income Statement \\nThe total amounts of income and expense line items presented in the Consolidated Income Statement in which the effects of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are

The 2021 and 2020 results include a full year of compensation expense for issuances and conversions of stock-based compensation for Red Hat compared to six months in 2019. \\nThe companyÕs total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at December 31, 2021 was $1.4 billion and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years. \\nCapitalized stock-based compensation cost was not material at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. \\nIncentive Awards \\nStock-based incentive awards are provided to employees under the terms of the companyÕs long-term performance plans (the Plans). The Plans are administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. Awards available under the Plans principally include restricted stock units, performance share units, stock options or any combination thereof. \\nThere were 293 million shares originally authorized to be awarded under the company\\'s existing Plans and 66 million shares granted under previous plans that, if and when those awards were cancelled, could be reissued under the existing Plans. At December 31, 2021, 96 million unused shares were available to be granted. \\nSeparation of Kyndryl \\nIn connection with the separation of Kyndryl, as required by the CompanyÕs stock-based incentive award plans, the number of shares underlying remaining unvested stock awards was adjusted. The company also adjusted the exercise price and number of shares underlying outstanding stock options. All adjustments were made with the intent to preserve the intrinsic value of each award immediately before and after the separation. The adjustments to the number of shares and exercise price, as applicable, were determined using a ratio of 1.03 which was calculated by using the IBM share price based on the market closing price before and market opening price after the separation. The number of stock awards issued as a result of the adjustment was 0.8 million. The number of stock options issued and the respective decrease in exercise price as a result of the adjustment was immaterial. The terms of the outstanding awards remain the same and continue to vest over the original vesting periods. Any unvested stock awards held by employees of Kyndryl were cancelled at the time of separation. The adjustments to shares underlying unvested stock awards did not result in material stock-based compensation cost.  \\nStock Awards \\nStock awards for the period presented were made in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), including Retention Restricted Stock Units (RRSUs), or Performance Share Units (PSUs). \\nThe following table summarizes RSU and PSU activity under the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n \t  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n \\n \\n \tRSUs \t \\n \tWeighted-Average  \t \\nPSUs \t  \\nWeighted-Average  \t  \\n \\n     \tGrant Price      Number of Units      \\nGrant Price      \\nNumber of Units   \\nBalance at January 1, 2019 \\n \\n\t$130   \t9,802,704   \\n\\n$136   \\n2,419,695   \\nAwards granted \\n \\n119   \\n\\n5,650,861   \\n\\n117   \\n\\n1,395,534   \\nAwards released \\n \\n136   \\n\\n(3,145,016) \\n\\n140   \\n\\n(846,672) \\nAwards canceled/forfeited/performance adjusted \\n  \\n128   \\n\\n(981,921)\\n \\n131  \\n\\n(112,107)* \\nBalance at December 31, 2019 \\n \\n$123   \\n\\n11,326,628   \\n\\n$126   \\n\\n2,856,450  ** \\nAwards granted \\n \\n115   \\n\\n10,651,955   \\n\\n117   \\n\\n1,582,666   \\nAwards released \\n \\n126   \\n\\n(3,781,240) \\n\\n137   \\n\\n(630,974) \\nAwards canceled/forfeited/performance adjusted \\n  \\n121   \\n\\n(1,300,639)\\n \\n125  \\n\\n(256,642)* \\nBalance at December 31, 2020 \\n \\n$117   \\n\\n16,896,704   \\n\\n$120   \\n\\n3,551,500  ** \\nAwards granted \\n \\n125   \\n\\n9,566,307   \\n\\n129   \\n\\n1,561,120   \\nAwards released \\n \\n120   \\n\\n(4,582,159) \\n\\n129   \\n\\n(581,397) \\nAwards canceled/forfeited/performance adjusted \\n \\n119   \\n\\n(2,072,800) \\n\\n124   \\n\\n(453,178)* \\nKyndryl separation - adjustment  \\n \\nÑ   \\n\\n660,089   \\n\\nÑ   \\n\\n120,428   \\nKyndryl separation - cancellation \\n  \\n119   \\n\\n(1,429,661)\\n \\n119  \\n\\n(469,616) \\nBalance at December 31, 2021 \\n \\n \\n \t \\n$116   \\n \t \\n \\n19,038,480   \\n \\n \\n$118   \\n \t \\n \\n3,728,857  ** \\n \\n* Includes adjustments of (223,397), (70,089) and (8,544) PSUs for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, because final performance metrics were above or below specified targets. \\n** Represents the number of shares expected to be issued based on achievement of grant date performance targets.

As of December 31, 2021, these options were vested with a weighted-average exercise price of $135 per share and had a remaining weighted-average contractual life of approximately 4.1 years. The options are exercisable within a range of $125 to $149. These vested options have an intrinsic value of $4.5 million as of December 31, 2021. \\nThe company has not granted options since 2016. No material stock options were exercised, forfeited or canceled during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Beginning in 2022, options will be granted by the company as part of its executive compensation programs. \\nThe company settles employee stock option exercises primarily with newly issued common shares and, occasionally, with treasury shares. Total treasury shares held at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately 1,351 million and 1,350 million shares, respectively. \\nAcquisitions \\nIn connection with the acquisition of Red Hat in July 2019, the company issued and assumed 6.4 million stock awards with a fair value of $845 million. A share conversion ratio of 1.35 was applied to convert Red HatÕs outstanding equity awards for Red HatÕs common stock into IBM stock awards. At December 31, 2021, there were 0.7 million of these stock awards outstanding with a weighted-average grant price of $127 per share. \\n \t \\nIn connection with various other acquisition transactions, there was an additional 0.6 million stock options outstanding at December 31, 2021, as a result of the companyÕs conversion of stock-based awards previously granted by acquired entities. The weighted-average exercise price of these awards was $26 per share. \\nIBM Employees Stock Purchase Plan \\nThe company maintains a non-compensatory Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP enables eligible participants to purchase shares of IBM common stock at a 5 percent discount off the average market price on the day of purchase through payroll deductions of up to 10 percent of eligible compensation. Eligible compensation includes any compensation received by the employee during the year. The ESPP provides for semi-annual offering periods during which shares may be purchased and continues as long as shares remain available under the ESPP, unless terminated earlier at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Individual ESPP participants are restricted from purchasing more than $25,000 of common stock in one calendar year or 1,000 shares in an offering period. \\nEmployees purchased approximately one million shares under the ESPP during each year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Cash dividends declared and paid by the company on its common stock also include cash dividends on the company stock purchased through the ESPP. Dividends are paid on full and fractional shares and can be reinvested. The company stock purchased through the ESPP is considered outstanding and is included in the weighted-average outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. \\nApproximately 16.8 million shares were available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2021. \\nEffective April 1, 2022, the company will increase the discount from 5 percent to 15 percent off the average market price on the date of purchase for eligible participants under its ESPP. This change is expected to result in the ESPP being considered compensatory under the accounting requirements for stock-based compensation. \\n\\nNOTE W.

Cash flows from the companyÕs expected benefit obligation payments are matched to the yield curve to derive the discount rates. \\n \\nIn other non-U.S. countries where the markets for high-quality long-term bonds are not as well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a base, and a credit spread is added to simulate corporate bond yields at these maturities in the jurisdiction of each plan. This is the benchmark for developing the respective discount rates. \\n \\nExpected \\nLong-Term \\nReturns on \\nPlan Assets \\n \\nRepresents the expected long-term returns on plan assets based on the calculated market-related value of plan assets and considers long-term expectations for future returns and the investment policies and strategies discussed on pages 129 to 130. These rates of return are developed and tested for reasonableness against historical returns by the company. \\n \\nThe use of expected returns may result in pension income that is greater or less than the actual return of those plan assets in a given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns, and therefore result in a pattern of income or loss recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees. \\n \\nThe difference between actual and expected returns is recognized as a component of net loss or gain in AOCI, which is amortized as a component of net periodic (income)/cost over the service lives or life expectancy of the plan participants, depending on the plan, provided such amounts exceed certain thresholds provided by accounting standards. The market-related value of plan assets recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets systematically over a five-year period in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic (income)/cost. \\n \\nThe projected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2022 is 4.0 percent for U.S. and 2.97 percent for nonU.S. DB Plans. \\n \\nRate of \\nCompensation \\nIncreases and \\nMortality \\nAssumptions \\n \\nCompensation rate increases are determined based on the companyÕs long-term plans for such increases. These rate increases are not applicable to the U.S. DB pension plans as benefit accruals ceased December 31, 2007. \\n \\nMortality assumptions are based on life expectancy and death rates for different types of participants and are periodically updated based on actual experience. \\n \\nInterest \\nCrediting Rate \\n \\nBenefits for certain participants in the PPP are calculated using a cash balance formula. An assumption underlying this formula is an interest crediting rate, which impacts both net periodic (income)/cost and the PBO. This provides the basis for projecting the expected interest rate that plan participants will earn on the benefits that they are expected to receive in the following year and is based on the average from August to October of the one-year U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity yield plus one percent. \\n \\nHealthcare \\nCost Trend \\nRate \\n \\nFor nonpension postretirement benefit plans, the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates. The healthcare cost trend rate has an insignificant effect on plan costs or the benefit obligation due to the terms of the plan which limit the companyÕs obligation to the participants. \\n \\nThe companyÕs U.S. healthcare cost trend rate assumption for 2022 is 6.0 percent. The company assumes that trend rate will decrease to 5.0 percent over the next six years. \\n \\nPlan Assets \\nRetirement-related benefit plan assets are recognized and measured at fair value. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations, these fair value measurements may not necessarily reflect the amounts the company could realize in current market transactions. \\nInvestment Policies and Strategies \\nThe investment objectives of the Qualified PPP portfolio are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. The precise amount for which these obligations will be settled depends on future events, including the retirement dates and life expectancy of the plansÕ participants. The obligations are estimated using actuarial assumptions, based on the current economic environment and other pertinent factors described above. The Qualified PPP portfolioÕs investment strategy balances the requirement to generate returns, using potentially higher yielding assets such as equity securities, with the need to control risk in the portfolio with less volatile assets, such as fixed-income securities. Risks include, among others, inflation, volatility in equity values and changes in interest rates that could cause the plan to become underfunded, thereby increasing its dependence on contributions from the company. To mitigate any potential concentration risk, careful consideration is given to balancing the portfolio among industry sectors, companies and geographies, taking into account interest rate sensitivity, dependence on economic growth, currency and other factors that affect investment returns. There were no significant changes to investment strategy made in 2021 and none are planned for 2022. The Qualified PPP portfolioÕs target allocation is 10 percent equity securities, 82 percent fixed-income securities, 3 percent real estate and 4 percent other investments. \\nThe assets are managed by professional investment firms and investment professionals who are employees of the company. They are bound by investment mandates determined by the companyÕs management and are measured against specific benchmarks. Among these managers, consideration is given, but not limited to, balancing security concentration, issuer concentration, investment style and reliance on particular active and passive investment strategies. \\nMarket liquidity risks are tightly controlled, with $4,049 million of the Qualified PPP portfolio as of December 31, 2021 invested in private market assets consisting of private equities and private real estate investments, which are less liquid than publicly traded securities. In addition, the Qualified PPP portfolio had $1,066 million in commitments for future investments in private markets to be made over a number of years. These commitments are expected to be funded from plan assets. \\nDerivatives are used as an effective means to achieve investment objectives and/or as a component of the planÕs risk management strategy. The primary reasons for the use of derivatives are fixed income management, including duration, interest rate management and credit exposure, cash equitization and to manage currency strategies. \\nOutside the U.S., the investment objectives are similar to those described previously, subject to local regulations. The weightedaverage target allocation for the non-U.S. plans is 16 percent equity securities, 71 percent fixed-income securities, 3 percent real estate and 10 percent other investments, which is consistent with the allocation decisions made by the companyÕs management. In some countries, a higher percentage allocation to fixed income is required to manage solvency and funding risks. In others, the responsibility for managing the investments typically lies with a board that may include up to 50 percent of members elected by employees and retirees. This can result in slight differences compared with the strategies previously described. The percentage of nonU.S. plans investment in assets that are less liquid is consistent with the U.S. plan. The use of derivatives is also consistent with the \\nU.S. plan and mainly for currency hedging, interest rate risk management, credit exposure and alternative investment strategies. \\nThe companyÕs nonpension postretirement benefit plans are underfunded or unfunded. For some plans, the company maintains a nominal, highly liquid trust fund balance to ensure timely benefit payments. \\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Assets \\nThe following table presents the companyÕs defined benefit pension plansÕ asset classes and their associated fair value at December 31, 2021.

There were no changes in valuation techniques during 2021 and 2020. \\nEquity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded. IBM common stock is valued at the closing price reported on the New York Stock Exchange. Mutual funds are typically valued based on quoted market prices. These assets are generally classified as Level 1. \\nThe fair value of fixed-income securities is typically estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are generally classified as Level 2. If available, they are valued using the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. \\nCash includes money market accounts that are valued at their cost plus interest on a daily basis, which approximates fair value. Shortterm investments represent securities with original maturities of one year or less. These assets are classified as Level 1 or Level 2. \\nReal estate valuations require significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such assets. These assets are initially valued at cost and are reviewed periodically utilizing available and relevant market data, including appraisals, to determine if the carrying value of these assets should be adjusted. These assets are classified as Level 3. \\nExchange-traded derivatives are valued at the closing price reported on the exchange on which the individual securities are traded, while forward contracts are valued using a mid-close price. Over-the-counter derivatives are typically valued using pricing models. The models require a variety of inputs, including, for example, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility and foreign exchange rates. These assets are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 depending on availability of quoted market prices. \\nCertain investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. These investments, which include commingled funds, hedge funds, private equity and real estate partnerships, are typically valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund and reviewed by the company. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus liabilities and divided by the number of shares or units outstanding. \\nContributions and Direct Benefit Payments \\nIt is the companyÕs general practice to fund amounts for pensions sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws and local tax laws. From time to time, the company contributes additional amounts as it deems appropriate. \\nThe following table presents the contributions made to the non-U.S. DB plans, nonpension postretirement benefit plans, multiemployer plans, DC plans and direct payments for 2021 and 2020. The cash contributions to the multi-employer plans represent the annual cost included in the net periodic (income)/cost recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement. The companyÕs participation in multi-employer plans has no material impact on the companyÕs financial statements. \\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n($ in millions) \t \t  \t \t  \\nFor the years ended December 31: \\n     \\n2021      \\n2020 \\nNon-U.S. DB plans \\n  \\n$\t86   \\n$ 166  \\nNonpension postretirement benefit plans \\n  \\n \t319  \\n \t325  \\nMulti-employer plans \\n \\n \t17  \\n \t23  \\nDC plans \\n \\n \t992  \\n 1,015  \\nDirect benefit payments \\n \\n \t671  \\n \t538  \\nTotal \\n \\n \\n \\n$2,085  \\n \t \t \\n$ 2,066  \\n \t \\n \\nIn 2021 and 2020, $416 million and $452 million, respectively, of contributions to the non-U.S. DB plans and nonpension postretirement benefit plans were made in U.S. Treasury securities. Additionally, in 2021 and 2020, contributions of $424 million and $288 million, respectively, were made to the Active Medical Trust in U.S. Treasury securities. Contributions made with U.S. Treasury securities are considered a non-cash transaction. \\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans \\nIn 2022, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. However, depending on market conditions, or other factors, the company may elect to make discretionary contributions to the Qualified PPP during the year. \\nIn 2022, the company estimates contributions to its non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans to be approximately $200 million, the largest of which will be contributed to defined benefit pension plans in Spain and Japan. This amount generally represents legally mandated minimum contributions. \\nFinancial market performance in 2022 could increase the legally mandated minimum contribution in certain countries which require monthly or daily remeasurement of the funded status.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS \\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.64 per common share. The dividend is payable March 10, 2022 to shareholders of record on February 11, 2022. \\n \\nOn February 9, 2022, the company issued $2.3 billion of Euro fixed-rate notes in tranches with maturities ranging from 8 to 12 years and coupons ranging from 0.875 to 1.25 percent and $1.8 billion of U.S. dollar fixed-rate notes with maturities ranging from 5 to 30 years and coupons ranging from 2.20 to 3.43 percent. \\n \\n \\n\\nPerformance Graph  \\n \\n \\nCOMPARISON OF FIVE-YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN FOR IBM, S&P 500 STOCK INDEX AND S&P INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDEX \\nThe following graph compares the five-year cumulative total returns for IBM common stock with the comparable cumulative returns of certain Standard & PoorÕs (S&P) indices. Due to the fact that IBM is a company included in the S&P 500 Stock Index, the SECÕs rules require the use of that index for the required five-year graph. Under those rules, the second index used for comparison may be a published industry or line-of-business index. The S&P Information Technology Index is such an index. IBM is also included in this index. \\nThe graph assumes $100 invested on December 31 (of the initial year shown in the graph) in IBM common stock and $100 invested on the same date in each of the S&P indices. The comparisons assume that all dividends are reinvested. On November 3, 2021, we completed the separation of Kyndryl. IBM stockholders received one share of common stock in Kyndryl for every five shares of IBM common stock held at the close of business on October 25, 2021, the record date for the distribution. The effect of the Kyndryl transaction is reflected in the cumulative total return as reinvested dividends. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \\n\\n(U.S. Dollar) \t \\n     \t2016      \t2017      \t2018      \t2019      \t2020      \t2021 \\n                International Business Machines \\n $ 100.00  $ 96.02  $ 74.38  $ 91.92  $ 90.83  $ 106.10  \\n¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ \t  S & P 500 \\n   100.00    121.83    116.49    153.17    181.35    233.41  \\n \t-  -  -  -    S & P Information Technology  \\n      100.00       138.83       138.43       208.05       299.37       402.73  \\n \\n \\n \\nSelected Quarterly Data \\n \\nThis section provides summarized quarterly data for 2021 and 2020.
